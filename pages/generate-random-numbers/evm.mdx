# How to Generate Random Numbers in EVM Contracts Using Pyth Entropy

This guide explains how to integrate Pyth Entropy into an EVM Contract to generate on-chain random numbers.
The intended audience for this guide is developers of any application that needs on-chain randomness, such as NFT mints or games.

## Install the SDK

Pyth Entropy has a Solidity SDK that lets your contract interact with the Entropy contract.
Install the SDK using your package manager:

```shell copy
npm install @pythnetwork/entropy-sdk-solidity
```

## Setup

To use the SDK, you need the address of an Entropy contract on your blockchain.
Consult the current [Entropy contract addresses](../contract-addresses/entropy-evm.mdx) to find the address on your chain.
Once you have a contract address, instantiate an `IEntropy` contract in your solidity contract:

```solidity copy
 IEntropy entropy = IEntropy(<address>);
```

Entropy also requires selecting a randomness provider.
The randomness provider is a third-party who participates in the generation process.
Each provider is identified by an address and hosts the Fortuna webservice at a URI.
You will need both the provider address and the URL for the integration.

The simplest way to choose a provider is to use the default provider.
The default provider for each contract and their corresponding URI is also listed in the
[Entropy contract addresses](../contract-addresses/entropy-evm.mdx).

You can also get the default provider's address by calling the `getDefaultProvider` method, then
get the provider's Fortuna URI by calling `getProviderInfo`:

```solidity copy
address provider = entropy.getDefaultProvider();
bytes providerUri = entropy.getProviderInfo().uri;
```

## Usage

To generate a random number, follow these steps.

### 1. Commit to a random number

Generate a 32-byte random number on the client side, then hash it with keccak256 to create a commitment.
You can do this with typescript and web3.js as follows:

```typescript copy
const randomNumber = web3.utils.randomHex(32);
const commitment = web3.utils.keccak256(randomNumber);
```

### 2. Request a number from Entropy

Invoke the `request` method of the `IEntropy` contract.
The `request` method requires paying a fee in native gas tokens which is configured per-provider.
Use the `getFee` method to calculate the fee and send it as the value of the `request` call:

```solidity copy
uint fee = entropy.getFee(provider);
uint64 sequenceNumber = entropy.request{value: fee}(provider, commitment, true);
```

This method returns a sequence number. Store this sequence number for use in later steps.
If you are invoking this off-chain, the method also emits a `PythRandomEvents.Requested` event that contains the sequence number in it.

### 3. Fetch the provider's number

Submit a query to the `/revelations/` endpoint of the provider's Fortuna webservice.
This endpoint takes a single path parameter, which is the sequence number of the request.

```typescript copy
await axios.get(`${providerUri}/revelations/${sequenceNumber}`);
```

This method returns a JSON object containing the provider's random number.

### 4. Reveal the number

Invoke the `reveal` method on the `IEntropy` contract:

```solidity copy
bytes32 randomNumber = entropy.reveal(
    provider,
    sequenceNumber,
    randomNumber,
    providerRandomNumber
)
```

This method will combine the user and provider's random numbers, along with the blockhash, to construct the final secure random number.

## Example Application

The [Coin Flip](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/ethereum/examples/coin_flip) example demonstrates how to build a smart contract that
interacts with Pyth Entropy as well as a typescript client for that application.
