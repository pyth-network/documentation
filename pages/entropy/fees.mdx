# Fees

The Entropy protocol has been designed to charge fees on a per-request basis. The total fee is 
the sum of the provider fee, which is determined by the individual provider on a per-blockchain 
basis, and the protocol fee, which is subject to Pyth governance decisions also on a per-chain 
basis. Providers can withdraw their fees from the contract whenever they want. 
The allocation of the fees collected by the Entropy protocol is governed by the 
collective decisions of its governance body. All fees are denominated in the native token 
of the respective blockchain, ensuring a seamless and integrated operation.

Note that protocols integrating with Entropy can pass these fees along to their users. Whenever 
a user submits a transaction that requires generating a random number, that transaction can also 
include payment of the necessary fee. This ensures that the user will pay in proportion to their 
usage of Entropy.
