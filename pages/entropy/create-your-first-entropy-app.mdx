# Create your first Entropy app on EVM

In this tutorial we will implement and deploy a coin flip contract which will use entropy to generate a random output. 

## Preliminaries

Before we start, please make sure you the following tools installed:

Foundry - [https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation). 
- Run `forge --version` to confirm it is installed. You should get an output similar to `forge 0.2.0 (23aa303 2023-11-28T00:35:15.730515000Z)`

Node (version > 18) - [https://nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- Run `npm -v` to confirm. You should get an output similar to `10.2.3`

## Getting Started

Create a directory named `coin-flip` in your filesystem. Open a terminal with `coin-flip` as the working directory and run `forge init contracts` to create a new Solidity project. You will see a new directory in `coin-flip` named `contracts`. `contracts/src` is where all your contract code will be. 

Run `cd contracts` to make it your terminal’s working directory — the following commands will need to be run from here.

Next, install the Pyth Entropy SDK by running the following commands.

```bash copy
npm init -y 
npm install @pythnetwork/entropy-sdk-solidity
```

Add a `remappings.txt` file to `contracts` directory with the following content.

```text copy
@pythnetwork/entropy-sdk-solidity/=node_modules/@pythnetwork/entropy-sdk-solidity
```

## Implementation

Create a new file `CoinFlip.sol` in `contracts/src` directory and add the following code into it to start

```solidity copy
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;
import "@pythnetwork/entropy-sdk-solidity/IEntropy.sol";

contract CoinFlip {
	event FlipRequested(uint64 sequenceNumber);
  event FlipResult(bool isHeads);

	IEntropy entropy;
	address provider;
	
	constructor(address _entropy, address _provider) {
	    entropy = IEntropy(_entropy);
	    provider = _provider;
	}
}
```

The code implements some events, properties and a constructor to instantiate the contract.  One of the properties is of type `IEntropy` which is an interface imported from the Entropy SDK. The constructor also takes a `provider` argument. We will see how to populate these later.

### Request a coin flip

```solidity copy
contract CoinFlip {
	...
	
	function request(bytes32 userCommitment) external payable {
    // checks
    uint128 requestFee = entropy.getFee(provider);
    if(msg.value < requestFee) revert("not enough fees");

		// pay the fees and request a random number from entropy
    uint64 sequenceNumber = entropy.request{value: requestFee}(provider, userCommitment, true);

		// emit event
		emit FlipRequested(sequenceNumber);
	}
}
```

Users will invoke the `request` method to initiate a coin flip with a request fee and passes in a `userCommitment` argument — we’ll see how to generate this later. The method first retrieves the fee required to request a random number from Entropy. It then include the fee in the request method call to entropy. Finally, the method emits a `FlipRequested` event with a `sequenceNumber`. This event is also defined in the code snippet above.

### Fulfill a request

```solidity copy
contract CoinFlip {
	...
	
	// fulfil a request 
	function fulfill(uint64 sequenceNumber, bytes32 userRandomness, bytes32 providerRevelation) external {
	    bytes32 randomNumber = entropy.reveal(provider, sequenceNumber, userRandomness, providerRevelation);
	
	    emit FlipResult(uint256(randomNumber) % 2 == 0);
	}
}
```

The fulfill method takes three arguments. The first is the `sequenceNumber`, which we saw was returned by the request method above. The next two are random numbers — we will see how to generate these values later. Finally, the method emits a `FlipResult` event with the result of the flip.

Yay! you have successfully implemented a coin flip contract. 

## Deploy

First, create a new wallet

```bash copy
cast wallet new
```

This command will generate a new Ethereum keypair, producing output similar to the following. Note that the address and private key will be different hexadecimal values.

```bash copy
Successfully created new keypair.
Address:     0xB806824fdA4b2b6631e9B87a86d42C9dfd04D129
Private key: 0x0d510c72fd2279155c717eb433ae598a83cfb34b09c2ada86bc424b481082023
```

We will export the values from the command above as environment variables to simplify the commands below. We will also export the RPC URL of the network. Run the following commands in your shell substituting the address and private key in the indicated places:

```bash copy
export ADDRESS=<address from above>
export PRIVATE_KEY=<your private key from above>
export RPC_URL="https://sepolia.optimism.io"
```

Next, use the [Superchain Faucet](https://app.optimism.io/faucet?utm_source=docs) to claim some test Sepolia ETH. Paste the address from the command above into the faucet to get your ETH. You can verify that the ETH has arrived in your wallet by running the command 

```bash copy
cast balance $ADDRESS -r $RPC_URL -e
```

The final step before deploying is to get the arguments for the contract's constructor: the [Entropy contract address](https://docs.pyth.network/entropy/contract-addresses) for Optimism Sepolia and [the Provider address](https://docs.pyth.network/entropy/contract-addresses). We will also export these values as environment variables for convenience:

```bash copy
export ENTROPY_ADDRESS=0x4821932D0CDd71225A6d914706A621e0389D7061
export PROVIDER_ADDRESS=0x6CC14824Ea2918f5De5C2f75A9Da968ad4BD6344
```

Finally, let's deploy the contracts. Run the following command:

```bash copy
forge create src/CoinFlip.sol:CoinFlip \
--private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
--rpc-url $RPC_URL \
--constructor-args $ENTROPY_ADDRESS $PROVIDER_ADDRESS
```

You should see an output similar to:

```bash copy
[⠢] Compiling...
[⠔] Compiling 28 files with 0.8.23
[⠑] Solc 0.8.23 finished in 3.40s

Transaction hash: 0x2178aa6d402c94166a93e81822248d00dd003827675ebd49b3c542970f5a0189
```

Let’s export the coin flip contract address as environment variable for later use:

```bash copy
export COINFLIP_ADDRESS=<Deployed to address from above>
```

Congratulations you have successfully implemented and deployed a  CoinFlip contract. 

## Interact from Javascript

Next, let’s interact with the CoinFlip contract from Javascript. Create a new directory inside `coin-flip` named `app`. Run `cd app` to make it your terminal’s working directory — the following commands will need to be run from here.

Run the following to initialise a new project and install required libraries.

```bash copy
npm init -y
npm install web3 @pythnetwork/entropy-sdk-solidity
```

Create a `script.js` file in `app` and add the following code to the script.

```javascript copy
const { Web3 } = require("web3");
const CoinFlipAbi = require("../contracts/out/CoinFlip.sol/CoinFlip.json");
const EntropyAbi = require("@pythnetwork/entropy-sdk-solidity/abis/IEntropy.json");

async function main() {
	const web3 = new Web3(process.env["RPC_URL"]);
  const { address } = web3.eth.accounts.wallet.add(process.env["PRIVATE_KEY"])[0];

	web3.eth.defaultBlock = "finalized"

	const coinFlipContract = new web3.eth.Contract(
    CoinFlipAbi.abi,
    process.env["COINFLIP_ADDRESS"]
  );

	const entropyContract = new web3.eth.Contract(
    EntropyAbi,
    process.env["ENTROPY_ADDRESS"]
  );

	...
}

main();
```

The code above imports the required libraries and defines a `main` method. In `main` we initialize web3 contracts that help us interact with the coin flip and entropy contracts. At the end, the script calls the main method. 

Next, add the following code to the main method to request a flip from the CoinFlip contract.

```javascript copy
async main() {
	...
	// Request a random number

	// Generate user random number and commitment
	const userRandomNumber = web3.utils.randomHex(32);
  const userCommitment = web3.utils.keccak256(userRandomNumber);

	const fee = await entropyContract.methods.getFee(process.env["PROVIDER_ADDRESS"]).call()
  console.log(`fee         : ${fee}`);

  const requestReceipt = await coinFlipContract.methods
    .request(userCommitment)
    .send({
      value: fee,
      from: address,
    });

  console.log(`request tx  : ${requestReceipt.transactionHash}`);
	// Read the sequence number for the request from the transaction events.
  const sequenceNumber =
    requestReceipt.events.FlipRequested.returnValues.sequenceNumber;
  console.log(`sequence    : ${sequenceNumber}`);
	
}
```

The code snippet above generates a random number and hashes it. The resulting hash is the user commitment. The code calls the Entropy contract to get the fee required for requesting a random number. Then it calls the request method of the CoinFlip contract with the `userCommitment` as an argument and the required fee. Finally, the code reads the sequenceNumber from the `FlipRequested`  event emitted by the CoinFlip contract. 

Next, add a snippet to get the provider’s random number.

```javascript copy
async main() {
	...
	// Fetch the provider uri
  const info = await entropyContract.methods
    .getProviderInfo(process.env["PROVIDER_ADDRESS"])
    .call();
  const providerUri = web3.utils.hexToString(info.uri);

	// Fetch provider commitment
  const res = await fetch(`${providerUri}/revelations/${sequenceNumber}`);
  const fortunaRevelation = await res.json();
}
```

The code first fetches the provider service URI from the Entropy contract and then fetches the provider’s random number from the service.

Finally, add the following code snippet to get the flip result.

```javascript copy
async main() {
	...
	// Fulfill the request
	const fulfillReceipt = await coinFlipContract.methods
    .fulfill(sequenceNumber, randomNumber, "0x" + fortunaRevelation.value.data)
    .send({
      from: address,
    });

  console.log(`fulfill tx  : ${fulfillReceipt.transactionHash}`);
  const isHead = fulfillReceipt.events.FlipResult.returnValues.isHeads;
  console.log(`flip result : ${isHead ? "Heads" : "Tails"}`);
}
```

The code above calls the `fulfill` method on the CoinFlip contract with the `sequenceNumber` returned from the `request` call above, along with the user's random number generated while requesting and the provider's random number fetched from Fortuna.

That’s it, Let’s run the script with the command `node script.js` . You should get an output similar to:

```
   fee          : 101
   request tx   : 0x9faf2f439f99986b4a87befbad89301b3ec8976038a8b8332c7c53cbba43fd95
   sequence     : 36
   fulfill tx   : 0x806900dbbebc8488ac6b87c9c82c5fd9ad38231c2e66b1899e0a8a3afe805f01
   flip result  : Tails
```

Note that: the script can fail due to some rpc issues. You can run the script again to get the expected result. 

## Next Steps
