# Generate Random Numbers

Integrations use a simple four-step process, with two off-chain steps and two-on chain steps:

1. **Commit** to a random number. Generate a random value off-chain and hash it to create a commitment.
1. **Request** a random number. Send a transaction with the commitment to the Entropy contract and receive a sequence number.
1. **Retrieve** part of the random number. Submit the sequence number from (2) to a webservice to receive a random payload.
1. **Reveal** the random number. Send a transaction with the sequence number from (2) , random value from (1), and the
   payload from (3) to the Entropy contract and receive the secure random number.

See [How to Generate Random numbers in EVM dApps](generate-random-numbers/evm.mdx) to integrate your application with Pyth Entropy.

Developers building on Entropy should also consult the [Best Practices](best-practices.mdx) section to learn how to avoid common security mistakes.
