# Generate Random Numbers

Integrations simply call an on-chain function to request a random number from Entropy.
This function takes a random number that you have generated off-chain and returns a sequence number.
Entropy will then callback your contract with the generated random number once the request is fullfilled by the provider.

See [How to Generate Random numbers in EVM dApps](generate-random-numbers/evm.mdx) to integrate your application with Pyth Entropy.
