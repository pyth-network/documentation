# Generate Random Numbers

Integrations use a simple one-step on-chain process:

1. **Request** a random number. Send a transaction with a random number that you have generated off-chain and receive a sequence number.

Entropy will callback your contract with the generated random number once the request is fullfilled by the provider.

See [How to Generate Random numbers in EVM dApps](generate-random-numbers/evm.mdx) to integrate your application with Pyth Entropy.
