# How to Generate Random Numbers in EVM Contracts Using Pyth Entropy

This guide explains how to integrate Pyth Entropy into EVM Contracts to generate on-chain random numbers.
The intended audience for this guide is developers of any application that needs on-chain randomness, such as NFT mints or games.

## Install the SDK

Pyth Entropy has a [Solidity SDK](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/ethereum/entropy_sdk/solidity) that lets your contract interact with the Entropy contract.
Install the SDK using your package manager:

<Tabs items={['hardhat', 'foundry']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```shell copy
npm install @pythnetwork/entropy-sdk-solidity
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```shell copy
npm init -y
npm install @pythnetwork/entropy-sdk-solidity
```

Then add the following line to your `remappings.txt` :

```text copy
@pythnetwork/entropy-sdk-solidity/=node_modules/@pythnetwork/entropy-sdk-solidity
```

</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Setup

The Solidity SDK exports two interfaces:

- [`IEntropyConsumer`](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/blob/main/target_chains/ethereum/entropy_sdk/solidity/IEntropyConsumer.sol) - The interface that your contract should implement. It makes sure that your contract is compliant with the Entropy contract.
- [`IEntropy`](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/blob/main/target_chains/ethereum/entropy_sdk/solidity/IEntropy.sol) - The interface to interact with the Entropy contract.
  You will need the address of an Entropy contract on your blockchain.
  Consult the current [Entropy contract addresses](../contract-addresses) to find the address on your chain.
  Once you have a contract address, instantiate an `IEntropy` contract in your solidity contract:

```solidity copy
import { IEntropyConsumer } from "@pythnetwork/entropy-sdk-solidity/IEntropyConsumer.sol";
import { IEntropy } from "@pythnetwork/entropy-sdk-solidity/IEntropy.sol";

// @param entropyAddress The address of the entropy contract.
contract YourContract(address entropyAddress) is IEntropyConsumer {
  IEntropy entropy = IEntropy(entropyAddress);
}
```

<Callout type="info">
Entropy also requires selecting a **randomness provider**. The randomness provider is a third-party
who participates in the generation process. Each provider is identified by an address and hosts
a keeper service for fullfilling requests.

The simplest way to choose a provider is to use the [default provider](../contract-addresses).
The default provider for each contract and their corresponding URI is also listed in the
[Entropy contract addresses](../contract-addresses).

</Callout>

You can also get the default provider's address by calling the [`getDefaultProvider`](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/blob/f8ebeb6af31d98f94ce73edade6da2ebab7b2456/target_chains/ethereum/entropy_sdk/solidity/IEntropy.sol#L94) method:

```solidity copy
address provider = entropy.getDefaultProvider();
```

## Usage

To generate a random number, follow these steps.

### 1. Generate a random number

Generate a 32-byte random number on the client side.

<Tabs items={["web3.js", "ethers.js"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```typescript copy const userRandomNumber = web3.utils.randomHex(32); ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```typescript copy const userRandomNumber = ethers.utils.randomBytes(32);
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### 2. Request a number from Entropy

Invoke the [`requestWithCallback`](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/blob/main/target_chains/ethereum/entropy_sdk/solidity/IEntropy.sol#L83) method of the `IEntropy` contract.
The `requestWithCallback` method requires paying a fee in native gas tokens which is configured per-provider.

The fees differs for every chain and can be found at the [Current Fees](../current-fees) page. \
You can use the onchain method [`getFee`](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/blob/main/target_chains/ethereum/entropy_sdk/solidity/IEntropy.sol#L101) to calculate the fee for the default provider and send it as the value of the `requestWithCallback` call:

```solidity copy
function requestRandomNumber(bytes32 userRandomNumber) external payable {
  uint256 fee = entropy.getFee(entropyProvider);

  uint64 sequenceNumber = entropy.requestWithCallback{ value: fee }(
    entropyProvider,
    userRandomNumber
  );
}

```

This method returns a sequence number and emits a [`RequestedWithCallback`](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/blob/main/target_chains/ethereum/entropy_sdk/solidity/EntropyEvents.sol#L10) event. You can store this sequence number to identify the request in next step.

### 3. Implement callback for Entropy

```solidity {28-38} copy
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import { IEntropyConsumer } from "@pythnetwork/entropy-sdk-solidity/IEntropyConsumer.sol";
import { IEntropy } from "@pythnetwork/entropy-sdk-solidity/IEntropy.sol";

contract YourContract is IEntropyConsumer {
  IEntropy entropy;

  // @param entropyAddress The address of the entropy contract.
  constructor(address entropyAddress) {
    entropy = IEntropy(entropyAddress);
  }

  // @param userRandomNumber The random number generated by the user.
  function requestRandomNumber(bytes32 userRandomNumber) external payable {
    // Get the default provider and the fee for the request
    address entropyProvider = entropy.getDefaultProvider();
    uint256 fee = entropy.getFee(entropyProvider);

    // Request the random number with the callback
    uint64 sequenceNumber = entropy.requestWithCallback{ value: fee }(
      entropyProvider,
      userRandomNumber
    );
    // Store the sequence number to identify the callback request
  }

  // @param sequenceNumber The sequence number of the request.
  // @param provider The address of the provider that generated the random number. If your app uses multiple providers, you can use this argument to distinguish which one is calling the app back.
  // @param randomNumber The generated random number.
  // This method is called by the entropy contract when a random number is generated.
  function entropyCallback(
    uint64 sequenceNumber,
    address provider,
    bytes32 randomNumber
  ) internal override {
    // Implement your callback logic here.
  }

  // This method is required by the IEntropyConsumer interface.
  // It returns the address of the entropy contract which will call the callback.
  function getEntropy() internal view override returns (address) {
    return address(entropy);
  }
}

```

When the final random number is ready to use, the entropyCallback function will be called by the Entropy contract. This will happen in a separate transaction submitted by the requested provider.

**The entropyCallback function should be implemented in the same contract that is requesting the random number.**
