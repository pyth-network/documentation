# How to Generate Random Numbers in EVM Contracts Using Pyth Entropy

This guide explains how to integrate Pyth Entropy into an EVM Contract to generate on-chain random numbers.
The intended audience for this guide is developers of any application that needs on-chain randomness, such as NFT mints or games.

## Install the SDK

Pyth Entropy has a Solidity SDK that lets your contract interact with the Entropy contract.
Install the SDK using your package manager:

```shell copy
npm install @pythnetwork/entropy-sdk-solidity
```

## Setup

The SDK exports a `IEntropyConsumer` interface that your contract should implement. The interface 
makes sure that your contract is compliant with the Entropy contract.

```solidity copy
import {IEntropyConsumer} from "@pythnetwork/entropy-sdk-solidity/contracts/IEntropyConsumer.sol";
contract YOUR_CONTRACT is IEntropyConsumer {
}
```

You will need the address of an Entropy contract on your blockchain.
Consult the current [Entropy contract addresses](../contract-addresses) to find the address on your chain.
Once you have a contract address, instantiate an `IEntropy` contract in your solidity contract:

```solidity copy
 IEntropy entropy = IEntropy(<address>);
```

Entropy also requires selecting a randomness provider. The randomness provider is a third-party 
who participates in the generation process. Each provider is identified by an address and hosts 
a keeper service for fullfilling requests.

The simplest way to choose a provider is to use the default provider.
The default provider for each contract and their corresponding URI is also listed in the
[Entropy contract addresses](../contract-addresses).

You can also get the default provider's address by calling the `getDefaultProvider` method:

```solidity copy
address provider = entropy.getDefaultProvider();
```

## Usage

To generate a random number, follow these steps.

### 1. Generate a random number

Generate a 32-byte random number on the client side.
You can do this with typescript and web3.js as follows:

```typescript copy
const randomNumber = web3.utils.randomHex(32);
```

### 2. Request a number from Entropy

Invoke the `requestWithCallback` method of the `IEntropy` contract.
The `requestWithCallback` method requires paying a fee in native gas tokens which is configured per-provider.
Use the `getFee` method to calculate the fee and send it as the value of the `requestWithCallback` call:

```solidity copy
uint fee = entropy.getFee(provider);
uint64 sequenceNumber = entropy.requestWithCallback{value: fee}(provider, randomNumber);
```

This method returns a sequence number. You can store this sequence number to identify the request in next step.

### 4. Implement callback for Entropy

```solidity copy
// It is called by the entropy contract when a random number is generated.
function entropyCallback(
    uint64 sequenceNumber,
    // If your app uses multiple providers, you can use this argument to 
    // distinguish which one is calling the app back.
    address provider,
    bytes32 randomNumber
) internal override {
    // Implement your callback logic here.
}
```
