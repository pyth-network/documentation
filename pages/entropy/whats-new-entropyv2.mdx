# What's New in Entropy V2

Entropy V2 is a major update to the Pyth Randomness Protocol.

It introduces a series of developer experience improvements, shaped directly by the feedback of teams using it in production:
configurable & customizable gas limits for callbacks, adding callback statuses, and an upcoming public Entropy Explorer.

## What's New

- [Configurable Gas Limits for Callbacks](#configurable-gas-limits-for-callbacks)
- [Enhanced Callback Statuses](#enhanced-callback-statuses)
- [Upcoming Public Entropy Explorer](#upcoming-public-entropy-explorer)

### Configurable Gas Limits for Callbacks

Entropy V2 introduces configurable gas limits for callbacks.
This allows teams to set the gas limit for their callbacks, which can be useful for:

- Computing expensive operations in the callback like minting an NFT collection.
- Save money on gas fees by setting a lower gas limit.

```solidity copy
// Calculate the fee for the custom gas limit
uint256 fee = entropy.getFeeV2(customGasLimit);

// Request random number with custom gas limit
uint64 sequenceNumber = entropy.requestV2{ value: fee }(customGasLimit);
```

### Enhanced Callback Statuses

Entropy V2 introduces callback statuses, which allow teams to track the status of their callbacks.
These callback statuses are emitted in the `Revealed` event.

Previous version of Entropy use to emit the following `RevealedWithCallback` event:

```solidity copy
event RevealedWithCallback(
    EntropyStructs.Request request,
    bytes32 userRandomNumber,
    bytes32 providerRevelation,
    bytes32 randomNumber
);
```

Based on the feedback from teams, we have added the following statuses to the `Revealed` event:

```solidity copy
event Revealed(
    address indexed provider,
    address indexed caller,
    uint64 indexed sequenceNumber,
    bytes32 randomNumber,
    bytes32 userContribution,
    bytes32 providerContribution,
    bool callbackFailed,
    bytes callbackReturnValue,
    uint32 callbackGasUsed,
    bytes extraArgs
);
```

This updated `Revealed` event

- denormalizes fields from `EntropyStructs.Request` to a flat representation in the `Revealed` event for easier consumption.
- adds a `callbackFailed` boolean to indicate if the callback failed.

This will help teams to easily track the status of their callbacks and re-request them if they fail on-chain.

### Upcoming Public Entropy Explorer

Entropy V2 introduces an upcoming public Entropy Explorer, which will allow teams to easily track the status of their callbacks and re-request them if they fail on-chain.

This will help teams to easily track the status of their callbacks and re-request them if they fail on-chain.
