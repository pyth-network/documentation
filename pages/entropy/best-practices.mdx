# Best Practices

Developers integrating Entropy into their applications should consider using some of the following patterns and best practices.

## Incomplete Requests

Note: The following best practices are only applicable for the old flow.

Users of Entropy-powered protocols can choose not to complete the protocol.
They can compute the random number after it is fully determined, but before revealing it to the contract.
Hence, they can choose to stop the protocol at this point if they do not like the chosen random number.

Integrators should ensure that the user is always incentivized to reveal their random number. Integrators can ensure incentive alignment by following two simple rules:

- Only charge the user fees when the random number is requested.
- Only return value to the user when the random number is revealed.

For example, in an NFT mint, the user should pay for the NFT in the request step, and receive the NFT in the reveal step.
If the mint contract instead charged the user in the reveal step, the user could see the random attributes of the NFT before deciding whether or not to pay for it.
