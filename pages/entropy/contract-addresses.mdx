# Entropy Contract Addresses on EVM

## Mainnets

<EntropyDeploymentTable
  deployments={Object.fromEntries(
    Object.entries(EntropyDeployments).filter(
      ([k, v]) => v.network === "mainnet"
    )
  )}
  showReveal={true}
/>

### Gas Limits (Dynamic)

The following table shows the current gas limits fetched directly from the blockchain:

<EntropyGasLimitTable
  deployments={Object.fromEntries(
    Object.entries(EntropyDeployments).filter(
      ([k, v]) => v.network === "mainnet" && v.rpc !== undefined
    )
  )}
/>

**The default provider for above mainnet chains is `0x52DeaA1c84233F7bb8C8A45baeDE41091c616506`.**

The default provider on mainnet has a reveal delay to avoid changes on the outcome of the Entropy request because of block reorgs.
The reveal delay shows how many blocks should be produced after the block including the request transaction in order to reveal and submit a callback transaction.

The default provider fulfills the request by sending a transaction with a gas limit as mentioned in above table. Entropy callbacks the consumer as part of this transaction.

## Testnets

<EntropyDeploymentTable
  deployments={Object.fromEntries(
    Object.entries(EntropyDeployments).filter(
      ([k, v]) => v.network === "testnet"
    )
  )}
  showReveal={true}
/>

### Gas Limits (Dynamic)

<EntropyGasLimitTable
  deployments={Object.fromEntries(
    Object.entries(EntropyDeployments).filter(
      ([k, v]) => v.network === "testnet" && v.rpc !== undefined
    )
  )}
/>

**The default provider for above testnet chains is `0x6CC14824Ea2918f5De5C2f75A9Da968ad4BD6344`.**

The default provider on testnet has reveal delays identical to the corresponding mainnet chains to ensure consistent behavior across environments.

The default provider fulfills the request by sending a transaction with a gas limit as mentioned in above table. Entropy callbacks the consumer as part of this transaction.
