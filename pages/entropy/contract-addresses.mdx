# Entropy Contract Addresses on EVM

## Mainnets

<EntropyDeploymentTable
  deployments={Object.fromEntries(
    Object.entries(EntropyDeployments).filter(
      ([k, v]) => v.network === "mainnet"
    )
  )}
  showReveal={true}
/>

The default provider for above mainnet chains is `0x52DeaA1c84233F7bb8C8A45baeDE41091c616506`.

The default provider on mainnet has a reveal delay to avoid changes on the outcome of the Entropy request because of block reorgs.
The reveal delay can be a number of blocks (measured from the `latest` block) or `safe` which means the reveal will be delayed until the request transaction is included in a block with `safe` tag.
Read [here](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/ethereum-commitment-levels) for more information on commitment levels.

The default provider fulfills the request by sending a transaction with a gas limit as mentioned in above table. Entropy callbacks the consumer as part of this transaction.

## Testnets

<EntropyDeploymentTable
  deployments={Object.fromEntries(
    Object.entries(EntropyDeployments).filter(
      ([k, v]) => v.network === "testnet"
    )
  )}
  showReveal={false}
/>

The default provider for above testnet chains is `0x6CC14824Ea2918f5De5C2f75A9Da968ad4BD6344`.

The default provider on testnet doesn't have a reveal delay. It reveals the commitment as soon as the request transaction is included in a block.

The default provider fulfills the request by sending a transaction with a gas limit as mentioned in above table. Entropy callbacks the consumer as part of this transaction.
