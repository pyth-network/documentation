# Entropy Contract Addresses on EVM

## Mainnets

<EntropyApiDataFetcher url={FORTUNA_API_URLS.MAINNET}>
  {(data, isLoading, error) =>
    isLoading ? (
      <p>Loading mainnet data...</p>
    ) : error ? (
      <p>Error loading mainnet data: {error}</p>
    ) : (
      <EntropyDeploymentTable deployments={data} showReveal={true} />
    )
  }
</EntropyApiDataFetcher>

**The default provider for above mainnet chains is `0x52DeaA1c84233F7bb8C8A45baeDE41091c616506`.**

The default provider on mainnet has a reveal delay to avoid changes on the outcome of the Entropy request because of block reorgs.
The reveal delay shows how many blocks should be produced after the block including the request transaction in order to reveal and submit a callback transaction.

The default provider fulfills the request by sending a transaction with a gas limit as mentioned in above table. Entropy callbacks the consumer as part of this transaction.

## Testnets

<EntropyApiDataFetcher url={FORTUNA_API_URLS.TESTNET}>
  {(data, isLoading, error) =>
    isLoading ? (
      <p>Loading testnet data...</p>
    ) : error ? (
      <p>Error loading testnet data: {error}</p>
    ) : (
      <EntropyDeploymentTable deployments={data} showReveal={true} />
    )
  }
</EntropyApiDataFetcher>

**The default provider for above testnet chains is `0x6CC14824Ea2918f5De5C2f75A9Da968ad4BD6344`.**

The default provider on testnet has reveal delays identical to the corresponding mainnet chains to ensure consistent behavior across environments.

The default provider fulfills the request by sending a transaction with a gas limit as mentioned in above table. Entropy callbacks the consumer as part of this transaction.
