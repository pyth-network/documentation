# Protocol Design

The Entropy protocol is an extension of a classical commit/reveal protocol.
The original version has the following steps:

1. Two parties A and B each draw secret random numbers, $x_A$ and $x_B$.
2. A and B hash their random numbers and share the hashes, $h_A = \mathrm{hash}(x_A)$ and $h_B = \mathrm{hash}(x_B)$
3. A and B reveal $x_A$ and $x_B$
4. Both parties verify that $\mathrm{hash}(x_A) = h_A$ and $\mathrm{hash}(x_B) = h_B$
5. The random number $r = \mathrm{hash}(x_A, x_B)$

This protocol has the property that the result is random as long as either A or B are honest.
Thus, neither party needs to trust the other -- as long as they are themselves honest, they can
ensure that the result $r$ is random.

Entropy implements a version of this protocol that is optimized for on-chain usage. The
key difference is that one of the participants (the provider) commits to a sequence of random numbers
up-front using a hash chain. Users of the protocol then simply grab the next random number in the sequence.

**Setup**: The provider P computes a sequence of $N$ random numbers, $x_i$ for $0 \leq i \leq N-1$:

- $x_{N-1} = \mathrm{random}()$
- $x_i = \mathrm{hash}(x_{i + 1})$

The provider commits to $x_0$ by posting it to the Entropy contract.
Each random number in the sequence can then be verified against the previous one in the sequence by hashing it, i.e., $\mathrm{hash}(x_i) = x_{i - 1}$

**Request**: To produce a random number, the following steps occur.

1. The user U draws a random number $x_U$, and submits $h_U = \mathrm{hash}(x_U)$ to the contract
2. The contract remembers $h_U$ and assigns it an incrementing sequence number $i$, representing which
   of the provider's random numbers the user will receive.
3. The user submits an off-chain request (e.g. via HTTP) to the provider to reveal the $i$'th random number.
4. The provider checks the on-chain sequence number and ensures it is > $i$. If it is not, the provider
   refuses to reveal the ith random number. The provider should wait for a sufficient number of block confirmations
   to ensure that the request does not get re-orged out of the blockchain.
5. The provider reveals $x_i$ to the user.
6. The user submits both the provider's revealed number $x_i$ and their own $x_U$ to the contract.
7. The contract verifies $\mathrm{hash}(x_i) = x_{i-1}$ to prove that $x_i$ is the $i$'th random number. The contract also checks that $\mathrm{hash}(x_U) = h_U$.
   The contract stores $x_i$ as the $i$'th random number to reuse for future verifications.
8. If both of the above conditions are satisfied, the random number $r = \mathrm{hash}(x_i, x_U)$.
   As an added security mechanism, this step can incorporate the blockhash of the block that the
   request transaction landed in: $r = \mathrm{hash}(x_i, x_U, \mathrm{blockhash})$.

This protocol has the same security properties as the 2-party randomness protocol above: as long as either
the provider or user is honest, the number $r$ is random. Honesty here means that the participant keeps their
random number $x$ a secret until the revelation phase (step 5) of the protocol. Note that providers need to
be careful to ensure their off-chain service isn't compromised to reveal the random numbers -- if this occurs,
then users will be able to influence the random number $r$.

With automatic callbacks the flow is simplified:

1. The user U draws a random number $x_U$, and submits **both** $x_U$ and $h_U = \mathrm{hash}(x_U)$ to the contract
2. The contract remembers $h_U$ and assigns it an incrementing sequence number $i$, representing which
   of the provider's random numbers the user will receive. $x_U$ is recorded in the event logs.
3. After sufficient block confirmations, the provider submits a reveal transaction with $x_i$ and $x_U$ to the contract.
4. The contract verifies $\mathrm{hash}(x_U) = h_U$ and $\mathrm{hash}(x_i) = x_{i-1}$ to prove that $x_i$ is the $i$'th random number.
5. If both of the above conditions are satisfied,
   the random number $r = \mathrm{hash}(x_i, x_U)$ is generated and a callback is made to the requesting contract.

In this flow, providers can refuse revealing $x_i$ if the final random number $r$ is not in their favor, or
they may be able to access $x_U$ before on-chain submission (e.g. via mempool) and rotate their commitments to influence the random number $r$.
Of course, both of these behaviors are detectable and protocols can blacklist providers that exhibit them.
