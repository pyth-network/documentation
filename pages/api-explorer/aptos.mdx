The Pyth Network Aptos contract allows users to submit price updates for verification and store them for later use.
Please see the documentation section on [Pull Updates](../documentation/pythnet-price-feeds/on-demand) if you haven't already;
this section will explain the differences between Pyth Network and other oracles, and help you understand the expected usage patterns.

Users of the Pyth contract will typically need to perform two operations:

- Update the on-chain price -- In off-chain code, retrieve a verified price update from
  [Hermes](../documentation/pythnet-price-feeds/hermes) and submit it to the contract
  for verification. This operation makes the price available for on-chain use.
  You will typically call [update_price_feeds](aptos/update-price-feeds) to do this.
- Read the on-chain price -- After updating the price, your on-chain contract can call one of the
  many getter functions on the contract to get the price. See [get_price](aptos/get-price) and its variants
  for more information.
