# Introduction

Pyth Network is an oracle that publishes financial market data to multiple blockchains.
Our market data is contributed by over 80 [first-party publishers](https://pyth.network/publishers/), including some of the biggest exchanges and market making firms in the world.
We offer price feeds for a number of different asset classes, including [US equities, commodities, and cryptocurrencies](https://pyth.network/price-feeds/).
Each price feed publishes a [robust aggregate](documentation/how-pyth-works/price-aggregation.md) of publisher prices that updates multiple times per second.

Price feeds are available on multiple blockchains and can also be used in off-chain applications.
Pyth offers two sets of price feeds for different applications:

- [Solana Price Feeds](documentation/solana-price-feeds.md) are available in mainnet for Solana
- [Pythnet Price Feeds](documentation/pythnet-price-feeds.md) are available in mainnet for most [EVM chains](documentation/pythnet-price-feeds/evm.md), including Ethereum, BNB, Avalanche, and more.
  These feeds are also available in [Aptos](documentation/pythnet-price-feeds/aptos.md) mainnet and will be coming soon to Cosmos chains and other ecosystems.
