# Benchmarks

Pyth benchmarks allows users to query a historical archive of prices from [Pythnet Price Feeds](pythnet-price-feeds.md).
For example, applications can retrieve the price of BTC/USD as of last Friday at 8:00 AM UTC.
This price can be used for contract settlement or any other application that requires historical price data.
Benchmarks data is signed and verifiable on-chain with the same trust assumptions as Pythnet Price Feeds.

In order to maximize the reliability of the Pyth Benchmarks API, a request rate limit is enforced.
All endpoints limits are set at 30 requests every 10 seconds per IP address.
One exception: the TradingView endpoint will allow 90 requests every 10 seconds. Clients issuing request above the limit will receive a 429 (Too Many Requests) response for the subsequent 60-second period.
Users can access benchmark prices in several different ways, depending on the use case:

## TradingView Integration

There is a how-to guide for [integrating Pyth Benchmarks with TradingView](../../guides/how-to-create-tradingview-charts.mdx).

## Manual Browsing

The [benchmarks page](https://pyth.network/benchmarks) of the pyth.network website allows users to search the archive of benchmark prices.
It also provides default options for common settlement dates and times.
Users can select a time and see all of the Pyth prices that were active at that time.
Technically, each displayed price corresponds to the Pyth price update published just before the selected time; this ensures that the displayed price is the one a user would have seen if they observed the Pyth price at that time.

## On-Chain Contracts

On-chain contracts can consume benchmark prices using the same pull model as [Pythnet Price Feeds](pythnet-price-feeds.md).
Integrators can follow these three steps:

1. Use the [Hermes](pythnet-price-feeds/hermes) endpoint `/api/get_vaa` to retrieve a signed price update for the desired price feed and time.
   This endpoint will return a signed price update, specifically the price update immediately after the queried time.
   This step can be done in either a web frontend or a backend process, depending on who is expected to initiate the transaction.
2. Pass this price update to your on-chain contract as part of the transaction that needs the benchmark data.
3. In your on-chain contract, pass the price update to the `parsePriceFeedUpdates` function on the Pyth contract.
   This function will check the validity of the update and return the price of the requested asset (if valid).
   The price update will only be valid if the signatures are correct and the update falls within a user-configured time interval; integrators should set this time interval such that it matches their desired time.

Note that this process is similar to the standard process for consuming pull updates.
The main differences are that users call the `get_vaa` endpoint instead of `latest_vaas`, and the on-chain contract calls `parsePriceFeedUpdates` instead of `updatePriceFeeds`.
The pyth-crosschain repo has [example code](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/blob/main/target_chains/ethereum/sdk/js/src/examples/EvmBenchmark.ts) for an integration along the lines above for EVM chains.
