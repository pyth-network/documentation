# Pyth on NEAR

Pyth price feeds on NEAR are managed through the main NEAR Pyth smart
contract, enabling seamless interaction with on-chain data. In NEAR,
these interactions are facilitated by specific functions within the
Pyth receiver contract. This contract acts as an interface to Pyth
price feeds, handling the retrieval and updating of price data.

The two Key functions in the Pyth receiver contract to get started
are as follows:

- `update_price_feeds`: Updates multiple price feeds if they are fresh.
- `get_price`: Retrieves the current price from a specific price feed.

These functions are core for interacting with Pyth price feeds in
NEAR-based applications, providing a reliable and up-to-date source of
price information. For a full overview of methods provided by the NEAR
contract, see [the interface][] exposed by the receiver contract.

## How to Update and Consume Price Feeds

1. Install NEAR JavaScript SDK: First, add the NEAR JavaScript SDK to
   your project. You can do this using npm or yarn:
   ```
   npm install near-api-js
   ```
   or
   ```
   yarn add near-api-js
   ```
2. Interact with the NEAR contract. This can be done with the Contract
   interface. Updating a price feed can be achieved using the NEAR JS
   API. See the [official docs](https://docs.near.org/tools/near-api-js/quick-reference)
   for a guide on setting up a keystore correctly as this will depend
   heavily on your app. The skeleton you can use to get started for
   calling the Pyth contract looks like so:

   ```js
   // @data: A payload containing price feed update information fetched from Hermes.
   async function updatePriceFeeds(data) {
     const near = await connect(config);
     const result = await account.functionCall({
       "pyth.testnet",
       methodName: "update_price_feeds",
       args: { data },
       gas: new utils.BN("30000000000000"),
       attachedDeposit: utils.format.parseNearAmount("1"),
     });
     console.log("Update Price Feeds Result: ", result);
   }
   ```

   You can find an update to submit with this call from the Hermes API
   which for example [can be found for testnet here.](https://hermes-beta.pyth.network/)
   To try this out, use the `get_vaa` endpoint to request a price feed
   update for a price feed. You must convert the returned base64 blob to
   hex before using it in the `update_price_feeds` call due to NEAR passing
   bytes around with hex encoding.

   It's also possible to integrate this process into your contract itself
   to reduce the number of transactions required. See the example contract
   linked below.

   Note: gas and attachedDeposit are NEAR-specific parameters that you
   may need to set depending on the contract's requirements. Unused
   deposit will be refunded, but you can calculate an esimtate by calling
   the `get_update_fee_estimate` method against the Pyth contract.

   Fetching a price feed is similar:

   ```js
   async function fetchPriceFeed() {
     const near = await connect(config);
     const account = await near.account();
     const contractId = "pyth.testnet";
     const identifier = "PriceIdentifier";

     const priceFeed = await account.viewFunction(
       contractId,
       "get_price",
       args: { identifier }
     );

     console.log("Price Feed Data: ", priceFeed);
   }
   ```

## On-Chain Prices

For on-chain price interactions, see the [example contract][] in the
Pyth Github repo for an example of how to update and use prices
within a NEAR contract.

[example contract]: https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/near/example

A CLI-based approach can also be taken for interacting with Pyth prices,
see the [update.sh][] example script in the repository to see how to
pull prices with the official NEAR cli.
