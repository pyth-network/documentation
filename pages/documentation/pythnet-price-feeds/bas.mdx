description: Consume Pyth Network prices in applications on BNB Application Sidechains

# Deployment
If, as is highly likely, your BAS chain doesn't already have a deployment of Pyth, you will need to deploy the `pyth-crosschain` receiver contracts yourself. This is easy to do and will enable contracts deployed on your BAS chain to consume Pyth price feeds from the `PythUpgradable` contract.

To deploy the `pyth-crosschain` receiver contracts to your BAS chain:
- Clone the [pyth-crosschain repo](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain).

- Add your BAS network details to the [Truffle Networks configuration file](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/blob/main/target_chains/ethereum/truffle-config.js). An example using BAS test net is configured as below:
    ```json
    my_bas_testnet: {
        provider: () => new HDWalletProvider(
            process.env.MNEMONIC,
            "https://bas-aries-public.nodereal.io"
        ),
        confirmations: 10,
        networkCheckTimeout: 1000000,
        timeoutBlocks: 1000,
        skipDryRun: true,
      	network_id: 117,
    }
    ```
    
 - Prepare a `.env.prod.my_bas_testnet` environment file in the `pyth-crosschain/target_chains/ethereum` directory. Please note if you test the deployment in the test net, you need use the Testnet pyth variable of PYTH_TO_WORMHOLE_EMITTER like below. 
    ```shell
    # The truffle network name of your BAS chain, defined in the configuration earlier
    MIGRATIONS_NETWORK=my_bas_testnet
    
    # Keep these values the same
    MIGRATIONS_DIR=./migrations/prod-receiver    
    PYTH_TO_WORMHOLE_CHAIN_ID=0x1
    
    # Choose this value based on your network type (testnet, mainnet)
    # Testnet Pyth
    PYTH_TO_WORMHOLE_EMITTER=0xf346195ac02f37d60d4db8ffa6ef74cb1be3550047543a4a9ee9acf4d78697b0
    INIT_SIGNERS=["0x13947Bd48b18E53fdAeEe77F3473391aC727C638"]
    INIT_GOV_CHAIN_ID=0x1
    INIT_GOV_CONTRACT=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004
    # Mainnet Pyth
    # PYTH_TO_WORMHOLE_EMITTER=0x6bb14509a612f01fbbc4cffeebd4bbfb492a86df717ebe92eb6df432a3f00a25
    # INIT_SIGNERS=["0x58CC3AE5C097b213cE3c81979e1B9f9570746AA5"]
    # INIT_GOV_CHAIN_ID=0x1
    # INIT_GOV_CONTRACT=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004
    
    # Choose this value based on your network type (testnet, mainnet)
    # Testnet Pyth
    PYTH_TO_WORMHOLE_EMITTER=0xf346195ac02f37d60d4db8ffa6ef74cb1be3550047543a4a9ee9acf4d78697b0
    # Mainnet Pyth
    # PYTH_TO_WORMHOLE_EMITTER=0x6bb14509a612f01fbbc4cffeebd4bbfb492a86df717ebe92eb6df432a3f00a25
    ```
    
 - Now, under the pyth2wormhole/ethereum directory, install dependencies.

    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

 - Now run the Truffle migrations inside [`pyth-crosschain/target_chains/ethereum/migrations/prod-receiver/`](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/ethereum/migrations/prod-receiver) using the instructions [here](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/blob/main/target_chains/ethereum/Deploying.md). Make sure you are deploying using the right environment file and to the correct network.

 - You can verify the contracts have been deployed successfully using the example [here](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/blob/main/target_chains/ethereum/Deploying.md#testing).

# Usage
After the pyth2wormhole contracts have been deployed to your BAS chain, please refer to the [Pyth on EVM-based chains documentation](evm.md) for how to consume price feeds.
