# Pyth on Aptos

Aptos contracts can update and fetch the Pyth prices using the Pyth Aptos Contract, which has been deployed on Mainnet. The documented source code can be found [here](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/blob/main/target_chains/aptos/contracts/sources/pyth.move).

## Updating Price Feeds

The mechanism by which price feeds are updated on Aptos is explained [here](./pythnet-price-feeds.md). The [pyth-aptos-js](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/aptos/sdk/js) package can be used to fetch price feed update data which can be passed to the `pyth::update_price` on-chain function.

## Examples
- [Minimal on-chain contract](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/blob/main/target_chains/aptos/examples/fetch_btc_price/sources/example.move) which updates and returns the Pyth BTC/USD price.
- [Full-stack React app and on-chain contract](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/aptos/examples/mint_nft) which uses the [pyth-aptos-js](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/aptos/sdk/js) package to update the price used by the contract.

## Networks 

Pyth is currently deployed on Aptos Mainnet and Testnet.

## Addresses

When deploying contracts using Pyth, the [named addresses](https://diem.github.io/move/address.html#named-addresses) `pyth`, `wormhole` and `deployer` need to be defined at compile time. These addresses are the same across both Testnet and Mainnet.

| Named Address | Value                                                               |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `pyth`        | `0x7e783b349d3e89cf5931af376ebeadbfab855b3fa239b7ada8f5a92fbea6b387`|
| `wormhole`    | `0x5bc11445584a763c1fa7ed39081f1b920954da14e04b32440cba863d03e19625`|
| `deployer`    | `0xb31e712b26fd295357355f6845e77c888298636609e93bc9b05f0f604049f434`|

`deployer` and `wormhole` are implementation details of the Pyth contract: you will not need to interact with these.

## Price Feeds
