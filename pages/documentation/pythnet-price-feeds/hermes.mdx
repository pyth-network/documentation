# Hermes

[Hermes][hermes-repo] is a webservice that listens to the Pythnet and the Wormhole Network for Pyth price updates and serves them via a
convenient web API. Hermes is a backward-compatible rewrite of [Price Service](./price-service.mdx) that in addition to being more reliable,
delivers Pyth newer price update data that are cheaper to verify and use on-chain.

Hermes allows users to easily query for recent price updates via a REST API, or subscribe to a websocket for streaming updates.
The Pyth Network Javascript SDKs connect to an instance of the price service in order to fetch price updates.

## Public Endpoints

The Pyth Data Association operates two public endpoints for Hermes.
These endpoints can be used to test integrations with Pyth Network:

| channel | url                              |
| ------- | -------------------------------- |
| stable  | https://hermes.pyth.network      |
| beta    | https://hermes-beta.pyth.network |

For production deployments, developers integrating with Pyth Network are **strongly encouraged** to host their own instance of Hermes
or get a Hermes node from our rpc providers for maximum resilience and decentralization. The following node providers offer Hermes:

- [Triton](https://triton.one)
- [P2P](https://p2p.org)

## Usage

[Hermes API Documentation](https://hermes.pyth.network/docs) contains a comprehensive explanation of Hermes API for users interaction. As Hermes is using the price service
API you can use [the price service client library in JS](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/price_service/client/js) to interact with Hermes.

The following is an example of getting the latest update of the ETH/USD price feed using `curl`.

```sh copy
# Example API call
$ curl https://hermes.pyth.network/api/latest_price_feeds?ids[]=0xff61491a931112ddf1bd8147cd1b641375f79f5825126d665480874634fd0ace

# Example Response
[{"id":"ff61491a931112ddf1bd8147cd1b641375f79f5825126d665480874634fd0ace","price":{"price":"184136023127","conf":"177166324","expo":-8,"publish_time":1692110601},"ema_price":{"price":"184100641000","conf":"178704085","expo":-8,"publish_time":1692110601}}]
```

## Self-hosting Hermes

We provide a Helm chart for running Hermes at our [charts](https://github.com/pyth-network/charts/tree/main/charts/hermes)
repository. Please refer the the chart readme for the configuration values. You need a Pythnet RPC to run Hermes.
You can an RPC instance from any of the Pythnet RPC providers below:

- [Triton](https://triton.one)
- [P2P](https://p2p.org)
- [Blockdaemon](https://blockdaemon.com/)
- [Figment](https://figment.io)

You can alternatively host Pythnet RPC yourself but it is discouraged as running it
reliabily can be quite expensive and has a lot of maintenance over the network upgrades
and is discouraged. However, if you wish to still run it, please contact Pyth team for
more information.
