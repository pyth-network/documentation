# Hermes

[Hermes][hermes-repo] is a web service that listens to the Pythnet and the Wormhole Network for Pyth price updates, and
serves them via a convenient web API. It provides Pyth's latest price update data format that are more cost-effective
to verify and use on-chain.

Hermes allows users to easily query for recent price updates via a REST API, or subscribe to a websocket for streaming
updates. The Pyth Network's Javascript SDKs connect to an instance of Hermes to fetch price updates.

## Public Endpoints

The Pyth Data Association operates two public endpoints for Hermes, which can be used to test integrations with Pyth
Network:

| Channel | URL                              |
| ------- | -------------------------------- |
| Stable  | https://hermes.pyth.network      |
| Beta    | https://hermes-beta.pyth.network |

For production deployments, developers integrating with Pyth Network are **strongly encouraged** to host their own
instance of Hermes or obtain a Hermes node from our RPC providers for maximum resilience and decentralization.

## Hermes Node Providers

The following node providers offer Hermes:

- [Triton](https://triton.one)
- [P2P](https://p2p.org)
- [extrnode](https://extrnode.com/)

## Usage

The [Hermes API Documentation](https://hermes.pyth.network/docs) provides a comprehensive explanation of Hermes API for
user interaction. You can use [the price service client library in
JS](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/price_service/client/js) to interact with Hermes.

Here's an example of retrieving the latest update of the ETH/USD price feed using `curl`.

```bash
# Example API call
$ curl https://hermes.pyth.network/api/latest_price_feeds?ids[]=0xff61491a931112ddf1bd8147cd1b641375f79f5825126d665480874634fd0ace

# Example Response
[{"id":"ff61491a931112ddf1bd8147cd1b641375f79f5825126d665480874634fd0ace","price":{"price":"184136023127","conf":"177166324","expo":-8,"publish_time":1692110601},"ema_price":{"price":"184100641000","conf":"178704085","expo":-8,"publish_time":1692110601}}]
```

## Self-hosting Hermes

We provide a Helm chart for running Hermes in our
[charts](https://github.com/pyth-network/charts/tree/main/charts/hermes) repository. Please refer to the chart's readme
for the configuration values. You'll need a Pythnet RPC to run Hermes, which you can obtain from any of the Pythnet RPC
providers below:

- [Triton](https://triton.one)
- [P2P](https://p2p.org)
- [Blockdaemon](https://blockdaemon.com/)
- [Figment](https://figment.io)

Alternatively, you can host Pythnet RPC yourself, but this is discouraged due to the potential high cost and maintenance
involved in operating it. If you still wish to run it, please contact the Pyth team for more information.
