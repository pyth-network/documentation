# Hermes

[Hermes][hermes-repo] is a webservice that listens to the Pythnet and the Wormhole Network for Pyth price updates and serves them via a
convenient web API. Hermes is a backward-compatible rewrite of [Price Service](./price-service.mdx) that in addition to being more reliable,
delivers Pyth newer price update data that are cheaper to verify and use on-chain.

Hermes allows users to easily query for recent price updates via a REST API, or subscribe to a websocket for streaming updates.
The Pyth Network Javascript SDKs connect to an instance of the price service in order to fetch price updates.

## Public Endpoints

The Pyth Data Association operates two public endpoints for Hermes.
These endpoints can be used to test integrations with Pyth Network:

| channel | url                              |
| ------- | -------------------------------- |
| stable  | https://hermes.pyth.network      |
| beta    | https://hermes-beta.pyth.network |

## Usage

[Hermes API Documentation](https://hermes.pyth.network/docs) contains a comprehensive explanation of Hermes API for users interaction. As Hermes is using the price service
API you can use [the price service client library in JS](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/price_service/client/js) to interact with Hermes.

The following is an example of getting the latest update of the ETH/USD price feed using `curl`.

```sh copy
# Example API call
$ curl https://hermes.pyth.network/api/latest_price_feeds?ids[]=0xff61491a931112ddf1bd8147cd1b641375f79f5825126d665480874634fd0ace

# Example Response
[{"id":"ff61491a931112ddf1bd8147cd1b641375f79f5825126d665480874634fd0ace","price":{"price":"184136023127","conf":"177166324","expo":-8,"publish_time":1692110601},"ema_price":{"price":"184100641000","conf":"178704085","expo":-8,"publish_time":1692110601}}]
```

For production deployments, developers integrating with Pyth Network are **strongly encouraged** to host their own instance of Hermes for maximum resilience and decentralization.
By running an independent instance of this service, developers tap directly into Wormhole's peer-to-peer network to stream Pyth price updates.
This peer-to-peer network has built-in redundancy and is therefore inherently more reliable than a centralized service operated by the Pyth Data Association.
Please find more information about building and running the price service [here](../../guides/how-to-self-host-hermes.mdx).
