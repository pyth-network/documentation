# Off-chain Applications

We provide SDKs in various programming languages that allow you to read the values of Pyth price feeds in off-chain applications, such as web frontends:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="JavaScript" %}
There are different javascript SDKs for different purposes.

If you are developing an application that runs on any blockchain except Solana, then the javascript SDK for that blockchain supports querying and streaming live Pyth prices.
You can find the code for this SDK in the [pyth-crosschain](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain) repository, under `target_chains/<chain name>/sdk/js`.
These SDKs also support generating [on-demand price updates](on-demand.md) for your target blockchain.
An example for querying and streaming prices using these SDKs is shown [here](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/ethereum/sdk/js#off-chain-prices).

If you are developing an application for Solana, or without any blockchain whatsoever, then the [@pythnetwork/client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pythnetwork/client) npm package can be used to consume Pyth prices inside off-chain JavaScript programs.
An example can be found [here](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-client-js#example-usage).
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Rust" %}
The [pyth-sdk-solana crate](https://crates.io/crates/pyth-sdk-solana) can be used to consume Pyth prices inside your off-chain Rust programs. An example can be found [here](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-sdk-rs/blob/main/pyth-sdk-solana/examples/eth_price.rs).
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Python" %}
The [pyth-client-py](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-client-py) Python library can be used to consume Pyth prices inside your off-chain Python programs. An example can be found [here](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-client-py/blob/main/examples/read_one_price_feed.py).
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Go" %}
The [Blockdaemon pyth-go](https://github.com/Blockdaemon/pyth-go) client can be used to consume Pyth prices inside your off-chain Go programs.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
