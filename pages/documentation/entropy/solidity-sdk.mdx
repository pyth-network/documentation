# Pyth Entropy Solidity SDK

The Pyth Entropy Solidity SDK allows you to generate secure random numbers on the blockchain by
interacting with the Pyth Entropy protocol.
The SDK can be used for any application that requires random numbers, such as NFT mints, gaming, and more.

## Install

```shell copy
npm install @pythnetwork/entropy-sdk-solidity
```

## Setup

To use the SDK, you need the address of an Entropy contract on your blockchain and a randomness provider.
You can find current deployments [here](evm.mdx).

Choose one of the networks and instantiate an `IEntropy` contract in your solidity contract:

```solidity copy
 IEntropy entropy = IEntropy(<address>);
```

## Usage

To generate a random number, follow these steps.

### 1. Commit to a random number

Generate a 32-byte random number on the client side, then hash it with keccak256 to create a commitment.
You can do this with typescript and web3.js as follows:

```typescript copy
const randomNumber = web3.utils.randomHex(32);
const commitment = web3.utils.keccak256(randomNumber);
```

### 2. Request a number from Entropy

Invoke the `request` method of the `IEntropy` contract.
The `request` method requires paying a fee in native gas tokens which is configured per-provider.
Each entropy contracts has a default provider, you can get the default provider by calling the method `getDefaultProvider`.

```solidity copy
address provider = entropy.getDefaultProvider();
```

Use the `getFee` method to calculate the fee and send it as the value of the `request` call:

```solidity copy
uint fee = entropy.getFee(provider);
uint64 sequenceNumber = entropy.request{value: fee}(provider, commitment, true);
```

This method returns a sequence number. Store this sequence number for use in later steps.
If you are invoking this off-chain, the method also emits a `PythRandomEvents.Requested` event that contains the sequence number in it.

### 3. Fetch the provider's number

Providers store their uri, with some other metadata, on chain when registering and that can be fetched by calling the method `getProviderInfo`.
You need the provider's uri to fetch the provider's random number.

For the provider `0x6CC14824Ea2918f5De5C2f75A9Da968ad4BD6344` you can query the webservice at https://fortuna-staging.pyth.network :

```typescript copy
await axios.get(
  `https://fortuna-staging.pyth.network/v1/chains/${chainName}/revelations/${sequenceNumber}`
);
```

This method returns a JSON object containing the provider's random number.

### 4. Reveal the number

Invoke the `reveal` method on the `IEntropy` contract:

```solidity copy
bytes32 randomNumber = entropy.reveal(
    provider,
    sequenceNumber,
    randomNumber,
    providerRandomNumber
)
```

This method will combine the user and provider's random numbers, along with the blockhash, to construct the final secure random number.

## Example Application

The [Coin Flip](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/ethereum/examples/coin_flip) example demonstrates how to build a smart contract that
interacts with Pyth Entropy as well as a typescript client for that application.
