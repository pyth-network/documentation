# Protocol Design

The Entropy protocol is an extension of a classical commit/reveal protocol.
The original version has the following steps:

1. Two parties A and B each draw secret random numbers, `x_A` and `x_B`.
2. A and B hash their random numbers and share the hashes, `h_A = hash(x_A)` and `h_B = hash(x_B)`
3. A and B reveal `x_A` and `x_B`
4. Both parties verify that `hash(x_A) == h_A` and `hash(x_B) == h_B`
5. The random number `r = hash(x_A, x_B)`

This protocol has the property that the result is random as long as either A or B are honest.
Thus, neither party needs to trust the other -- as long as they are themselves honest, they can
ensure that the result `r` is random.

Entropy implements a version of this protocol that is optimized for on-chain usage. The
key difference is that one of the participants (the provider) commits to a sequence of random numbers
up-front using a hash chain. Users of the protocol then simply grab the next random number in the sequence.

**Setup**: The provider P computes a sequence of `N` random numbers, `x_i` for `(i = 0...N-1)`:

- `x_{N-1} = random()`
- `x_i = hash(x_{i + 1})`

The provider commits to `x_0` by posting it to the Entropy contract.
Each random number in the sequence can then be verified against the previous one in the sequence by hashing it, i.e., `hash(x_i) == x_{i - 1}`

**Request**: To produce a random number, the following steps occur.

1. The user U draws a random number `x_U`, and submits `h_U = hash(x_U)` to the contract
2. The contract remembers `h_U` and assigns it an incrementing sequence number `i`, representing which
   of the provider's random numbers the user will receive.
3. The user submits an off-chain request (e.g. via HTTP) to the provider to reveal the `i`'th random number.
4. The provider checks the on-chain sequence number and ensures it is > `i`. If it is not, the provider
   refuses to reveal the ith random number. The provider should wait for a sufficient number of block confirmations
   to ensure that the request does not get re-orged out of the blockchain.
5. The provider reveals `x_i` to the user.
6. The user submits both the provider's revealed number `x_i` and their own `x_U` to the contract.
7. The contract verifies `hash(x_i) == x_{i-1}` to prove that `x_i` is the `i`'th random number. The contract also checks that `hash(x_U) == h_U`.
   The contract stores `x_i` as the `i`'th random number to reuse for future verifications.
8. If both of the above conditions are satisfied, the random number `r = hash(x_i, x_U)`.
   As an added security mechanism, this step can incorporate the blockhash of the block that the
   request transaction landed in: `r = hash(x_i, x_U, blockhash)`.

This protocol has the same security properties as the 2-party randomness protocol above: as long as either
the provider or user is honest, the number `r` is random. Honesty here means that the participant keeps their
random number `x` a secret until the revelation phase (step 5) of the protocol. Note that providers need to
be careful to ensure their off-chain service isn't compromised to reveal the random numbers -- if this occurs,
then users will be able to influence the random number `r`.
