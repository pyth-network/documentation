# Entropy

Entropy allows developers to quickly and easily generate random numbers on the blockchain for applications such as NFT mints, gaming, and more.
The protocol is an [extension of a classical commit/reveal protocol](entropy/protocol-design.mdx) for random number generation.
Integrations use a simple four-step process, with two off-chain steps and two-on chain steps:

1. **Commit** to a random number. Generate a random value off-chain and hash it to create a commitment.
1. **Request** a random number. Send a transaction with the commitment to the Entropy contract and receive a sequence number.
1. **Retrieve** part of the random number. Submit the sequence number from (1) to a webservice to receive a random payload.
1. **Reveal** the random number. Send a transaction with the random value from (1) and the payload from (3) to the Entropy contract and receive the secure random number.

Pyth Entropy is currently available in testnet on several [EVM networks](entropy/evm.mdx).
Please see the documentation there for SDKs and integration examples.
Developers building on Entropy should also consult the [Best Practices](entropy/best-practices.mdx) section to learn how to avoid common security mistakes.
