# Network Interactions

The Pyth protocol consists of 2 on-chain core mechanisms:

- **Price aggregation** combines the reported prices and confidence intervals of individual publishers into a single price feed and confidence interval feed for a specific product (e.g. BTC/USD feed). This mechanism is designed to produce robust price feeds — feeds whose prices cannot be significantly influenced by small groups of publishers.
- **Governance** Governance is used to determining the size of update fees, determine reward distribution mechanism for publishers, approve other software updates to on-chain programs across blockchains, determine how products are listed on Pyth and their reference data (e.g.number of decimal places in the price, reference exchanges), determine how publishers will be permissioned to provide data for price
feeds.
