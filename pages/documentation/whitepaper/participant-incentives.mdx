# Participant Incentives

This section summarizes the benefits for the various Pyth network stakeholders:

**Publishers** are incentivized to stake PYTH tokens to participate in the protocol and earn a share of the rewards. Publishers earn a share of the data fees for the products they price. The data fees for a product will likely grow in proportion to consumer usage of the price feed. Publishing erroneous data (voluntarily or not) to the network may lead to the publisher's stake being slashed.

**Consumers** are incentivized to pay data fees because paying data fees attracts more publishers to the product, which improves the robustness of the price feed.

**Delegators** are incentivized to participate in the protocol to earn data fees (coming from consumersâ€™ data fees). Delegators will initially earn attractive payments, but competition between them will reduce the payments over time as the market becomes more efficient.
