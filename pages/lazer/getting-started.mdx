# Getting Started with Pyth Lazer

Pyth Lazer is a high-performance, low-latency price feed service that provides real-time financial market data to blockchain applications. This guide will walk you through setting up and running a basic JavaScript example to subscribe to Lazer price feeds.

## What You'll Learn

In this guide, you'll learn how to:
- Set up the Pyth Lazer JavaScript SDK
- Connect to the Lazer WebSocket stream
- Subscribe to real-time price feeds
- Handle both JSON and binary message formats

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 18 or higher)
- **pnpm** package manager
- **Git** for cloning the examples repository
- A **Lazer Access Token** - see [How to Acquire an Access Token](./acquire-access-token) if you don't have one

<Steps>

### Clone the Examples Repository

First, clone the Pyth examples repository which contains the JavaScript SDK example:

```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-examples.git
cd pyth-examples/lazer/js
```

### Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using pnpm:

```bash copy
pnpm install
```

This will install the following key packages:
- `@pythnetwork/pyth-lazer-sdk` - The main Lazer SDK
- `@solana/web3.js` - For Solana blockchain interactions
- Other supporting dependencies

### Configure Your Access Token

Set your Lazer access token as an environment variable:

```bash copy
export ACCESS_TOKEN=your_actual_token_here
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Replace `your_actual_token_here` with your actual Lazer access token. If you don't have one, follow the [access token guide](./acquire-access-token) to obtain it.
</Callout>

### Run the Basic WebSocket Example

Now you can run the basic example that demonstrates connecting to Lazer and receiving price updates:

```bash copy
pnpm run start
```

This will execute the main example script that:
- Connects to the Pyth Lazer WebSocket server
- Subscribes to price feeds (IDs 1 and 2)
- Listens for both JSON and binary messages
- Displays received price data and connection status
- Automatically shuts down after 10 seconds

### Understanding the Code

The main example code in `src/index.ts` demonstrates the core Lazer integration pattern:

```typescript
import { PythLazerClient } from "@pythnetwork/pyth-lazer-sdk";

const client = await PythLazerClient.create({
  urls: ["wss://pyth-lazer.dourolabs.app/v1/stream"],
  token: process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN!,
});

// Subscribe to price feeds
client.subscribe({
  type: "subscribe",
  subscriptionId: 1,
  priceFeedIds: [1, 2],
  properties: ["price"],
  formats: ["solana"],
  deliveryFormat: "json",
  channel: "fixed_rate@200ms",
  jsonBinaryEncoding: "hex",
});
```

Key concepts:
- **PythLazerClient**: The main client for connecting to Lazer
- **Subscription**: Defines which price feeds and properties you want to receive
- **Message Listeners**: Handle incoming price updates and connection events
- **Channels**: Control update frequency (e.g., "fixed_rate@200ms")

</Steps>

## What's Next?

Now that you've successfully run the basic Lazer example, you can explore more advanced integration patterns:

### Blockchain Integration

Learn how to integrate Lazer price feeds into your smart contracts:

- **[Solana Integration](./integrate-as-consumer/svm)** - Build SVM smart contracts that consume Lazer price feeds with cryptographic verification
- **[EVM Integration](./integrate-as-consumer/evm)** - Integrate Lazer into Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains

### Advanced Features

Explore additional Lazer capabilities:
