# How to Subscribe to Price Updates from Pyth Lazer

This guide explains how to subscribe to price updates from Pyth Lazer. This guide will also explain various properties and channels that one can use to customize the price updates.

Subscribing to price updates is a three-step process:

1. **Acquire** an access token.
2. **Adjust** subscription parameters.
3. **Subscribe** to the price updates via [websocket API](https://pyth-lazer.dourolabs.app/docs).

The websocket server is available at `wss://pyth-lazer.dourolabs.app/v1/stream{:bash}`.

<Steps>

### 1. Acquire an access token

Please fill out [this form](https://tally.so/r/nP2lG5) to contact the Pyth team and get the access token.

Use the access token to authenticate the websocket connection by passing it as an `Authorization{:bash}` header with the value `Bearer {token}{:bash}`.

### 2. Adjust subscription parameters

One can configure the request/subscription parameters to customize the received price updates. A sample request is shown below:

```js
client.send({
  type: "subscribe",
  subscriptionId: 1,
  priceFeedIds: [1, 2],
  properties: ["price"],
  chains: ["solana"],
  channel: "fixed_rate@200ms",
});
```

Here:

- `subscriptionId` is an arbitrary numeric identifier one can choose for a subscription. It will be returned back in response by the server. It doesn not affect the signed payload.
- `priceFeedIds` is the list of price feeds one like to receive. Data for all price feeds will be present in the signed price updates generated. Refer to the [Price Feed IDs list](../price-feeds-ids.mdx) for the supported price feeds.
- `properties` is the list of properties one can request, such as **price**, **bestBidPrice**, **bestAskPrice**, etc.
- `chains` is the list of chains for which one need a signed payload, such as **evm**, **solana**, etc.
- `channel` allows to configure the update rate: updates in the **real_time** channel are sent as frequently as possible, while **fixed_rate@200ms** and **fixed_rate@50ms** channels are updated at fixed rates.

There are also a few other parameters one may use. Refer to the [API documentation](https://pyth-lazer.dourolabs.app/docs) for more details.

### 3. Subscribe to the price updates

To subscribe to the price updates, one needs to send the request to the websocket server. The server will respond with a signed price update.

1. Pyth Lazer provides a [SDK](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/lazer/sdk/js) to seamlessly integrate the websocket API into your application.
   It can be installed using the following command:

```bash
npm install --save @pythnetwork/pyth-lazer-sdk
```

2. Then create a [`PythLazerClient`](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/blob/main/lazer/sdk/js/src/client.ts#L32) object using the URL and the access token requested from the Pyth team in the first step.

```js
import { PythLazerClient } from "@pythnetwork/pyth-lazer-sdk";

const client = new PythLazerClient(
  "wss://pyth-lazer.dourolabs.app/v1/stream",
  "ctoken1"
);
```

3. After the client is created, one can adjust the subscription parameters and subscribe to the price updates.

```js
client.ws.addEventListener("open", () => {
  client.send({
    type: "subscribe",
    subscriptionId: 1,
    priceFeedIds: [1, 2],
    properties: ["price"],
    chains: ["solana"],
    channel: "fixed_rate@200ms",
  });
});
```

4. One the connection is established, the server will start sending the price updates to the client.

```js
client.addMessageListener((message) => {
  console.log(message);
});
```

By default, price updates contain the `parsed` field that one can use to easily interpret the price update in their backend or frontend, as well as `evm` and/or `solana` fields that contain data that one should include in the on-chain transaction:

```json
{
  "type": "streamUpdated",
  "subscriptionId": 1,
  "parsed": {
    "timestampUs": "1730986152400000",
    "priceFeeds": [
      {
        "priceFeedId": 1,
        "price": "1006900000000"
      },
      {
        "priceFeedId": 2,
        "price": "2006900000000"
      }
    ]
  },
  "solana": {
    "encoding": "hex",
    "data": "b9011a82d239c094c52016990d6ca2b261dbb1157ad503cbd3ea0679493316150cf3457624d19ec3f6e0a0e94373ab0971e39d939beda15cc02eb3c5454eb700f1f7310df65210bee4fcf5b1cee1e537fabcfd95010297653b94af04d454fc473e94834f2a0075d3c7938094b99e52260600030201000000010000b5ea6fea00000002000000010000c58f44d3010000"
  }
}
```
