| Error                         | Explanation                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FeeSplitLargerThanPrecision` | The proposed fee split is invalid (split is larger than `FEE_SPLIT_PRECISION`, 10000)       |
| `FeesHigherThanBid`           | The fees to pay out exceed the value of the bid amount.                                     |
| `DeadlinePassed`              | The bid is no longer valid, as the Unix time deadline has passed.                           |
| `InvalidCPISubmitBid`         | The `SubmitBid` instruction should not be called via CPI.                                   |
| `MissingPermission`           | The transaction is missing a `SubmitBid` instruction with the matching permission key.      |
| `MultiplePermissions`         | The transaction should not contain more than one `SubmitBid` instruction.                   |
| `InsufficientSearcherFunds`   | The searcher lacks the funds to pay the specified bid amount.                               |
| `InsufficientRent`            | The fees splits received by different parties must be sufficient to cover the account rent. |
