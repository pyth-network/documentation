# Prepare Assets for Opportunity Adapter

The [`OpportunityAdapter`](https://github.com/pyth-network/per/blob/fccac65b00cff1cfe5c278b333a582fe66bda0f8/contracts/evm/src/opportunity-adapter/OpportunityAdapter.sol) is a utility contract that can be used for easier integration with Express Relay while maintaining maximum security.
In this integration, searchers use the [`Permit2`](https://github.com/Uniswap/permit2/) contract for safe asset management (`ERC20` tokens and Wrapped ETH) and the adapter contract to transfer bids, execute the opportunity, and ensure the assets are transferred correctly.
Using the `OpportunityAdapter` means that a searcher does not need to deploy their own custom contract for inventory management and routing to the protocol contracts where liquidation takes place.

In order to use `OpportunityAdapter`, you need to prepare your assets using the following steps. We use [`cast`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cast/) as a simple tool to interact with the blockchain but you can use any other tool you prefer.

<Steps>
### Transfer Tokens to your Wallet

Searchers are expected to own all the tokens that they expect to provide as `sell_tokens` for different opportunities.
They will also need to approve `WETH`, as the `OpportunityAdapter` will pay the bids by deducting the bid amounts from their wallet's `WETH` balance.

You can find the `WETH` contract address on the [contract address page](../../contract-addresses/evm).
Refer to the following command to deposit native ETH to `WETH`:

```bash copy
cast send \
--private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
--rpc-url https://mainnet.mode.network/  \
$WETH_ADDRESS \
"deposit()" --value 0.1ether # Change the value to the amount you want to deposit
```

### Approve your Assets to Permit2

Approve your tokens, including `WETH`, to the `Permit2` contract at `0x000000000022D473030F116dDEE9F6B43aC78BA3`.
This step enables token spending with off-chain signatures.

You can find the `Permit2` and `WETH` contract address on the [contract address page](../../contract-addresses/evm.mdx).

Refer to the following command to approve a token to `Permit2`:

```bash copy
cast send \
--private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
--rpc-url https://mainnet.mode.network/  \
$TOKEN_ADDRESS \
"approve(address spender, uint256 value)" \
0x000000000022D473030F116dDEE9F6B43aC78BA3 100000000000000000000000000 # You can use a large amount to avoid approving multiple times
```

</Steps>
