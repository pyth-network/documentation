# Integrate with opportunity adapter

The `OpportunityAdapter` is a utility contract that can be used for easier integration with express relay while maintaining maximum security. 
In this integration, searchers use the `Permit2` contract for safe asset management (`ERC20` tokens and Wrapped ETH) and the adapter contract to transfer bids, execute the opportunity, and ensure the assets are transferred correctly. 
Using the `OpportunityAdapter` means that a searcher does not need to deploy their own custom contract for inventory management and routing to the protocol contracts where liquidation takes place.

After [integrating with the auction server](./auction-server), you can integrate with the `OpportunityAdapter` framework via the following steps:
1. Hold your assets in your wallet. You will need to own all assets you expect to provide as `sell_tokens` to different opportunities. You will also need to approve `WETH`, as the `OpportunityAdapter` will pay your bids by deducting the bid amounts from your wallet's `WETH` balance.
2. Approve your assets to the `Permit2` contract, `0x000000000022D473030F116dDEE9F6B43aC78BA3`.
3. When bidding, set `target_contract` to the `OpportunityAdapterFactory` and craft your `target_calldata` based on the format of the `OpportunityAdapter`. The express relay [JavaScript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pythnetwork/express-relay-evm-js) and [Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/express-relay/) have helper functions that handle this step for you.
