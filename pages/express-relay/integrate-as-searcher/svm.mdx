# SVM Searcher Integration

SVM Express Relay searchers fulfill opportunities representing limit orders on the [Limo]() program.

<Steps>

### Subscribe to New Opportunities

Express Relay provides searchers with [Typescript](https://github.com/pyth-network/per/tree/8e311d3dce7a54865ff98b25e57c6af2dd984d1f/sdk/js) and [Python](https://github.com/pyth-network/per/tree/8e311d3dce7a54865ff98b25e57c6af2dd984d1f/sdk/python) SDKs to interact with Express Relay.
Searchers can also directly fetch available opportunities via HTTP or subscribe to them via WebSocket.

<Tabs items={['Typescript', 'Python', 'HTTP', 'Websocket']}>

<Tabs.Tab>
Pyth provides a Typescript SDK, which allows searchers to subscribe to opportunities:

```typescript
import { Client, Opportunity } from "@pythnetwork/express-relay-js";

const handleOpporunity = async (opportunity: Opportunity) => {
  // Implement your opportunity handler here
};

const client = new Client(
  { baseUrl: "https://pyth-express-relay-mainnet.asymmetric.re" },
  undefined, // Default WebSocket options
  handleOpporunity
);
await client.subscribeChains(["development-solana"]);
```

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
Pyth provides a Python SDK, which allows searchers to subscribe to opportunities:

```python copy
from express_relay.client import (
    ExpressRelayClient,
)
from express_relay.express_relay_types import Opportunity

def opportunity_callback(opportunity: Opportunity):
    # Implement your opportunity handler here
    pass

client = ExpressRelayClient(
    "https://per-staging.dourolabs.app",
    None,
    opportunity_callback,
    None,
)
await client.subscribe_chains(['development-solana'])
```

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
Searchers can request opportunities through an HTTP **GET** call to the [`/v1/opportunities`](https://pyth-express-relay-mainnet.asymmetric.re/docs#tag/opportunity/operation/get_opportunities) endpoint.

```bash copy
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://pyth-express-relay-mainnet.asymmetric.re/v1/opportunities?chain_id=development-solana&mode=live'
```

Opportunities are short-lived and could be executed in a matter of seconds. So, the above endpoint could return an empty response.

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
Searchers can connect to the server via WebSocket to reduce latency and subscribe to various events. The WebSocket endpoint lives at `/v1/ws`(e.g `wss://pyth-express-relay-mainnet.asymmetric.re/v1/ws`).
Here is a sample JSON payload to subscribe to opportunities:

```bash copy
{
  "id": "1",
  "method": "subscribe",
  "params": {
    "chain_ids": ["development-solana"]
  }
}
```

Consult [`Websocket API reference`](./websocket-api-reference.mdx) for a complete list of methods and parameters.

The server responds with opportunities in the following format:

```bash copy
{
  "order": "UxMUbQAsjrfQUp5stVwMJ6Mucq7VWTvt4ICe69BJ8lVXqwM+0sysV8OqZTdM0W4p...",      // The Limo order to be executed, encoded in base64
  "order_address": "DUcTi3rDyS5QEmZ4BNRBejtArmDCWaPYGfN44vBJXKL5",                     // Address of the order account
  "program": "limo",                                                                   // Identifier of the program that the order exists in
  "chain_id": "development-solana",
  "version": "v1"                                                                      // Opportunity format version
}
```

### Construct the Bid

Searchers should construct a bid by evaluating the fetched opportunity.
The SDKs provide an easy way to construct a bid; refer to these basic examples in [Typescript](https://github.com/pyth-network/per/blob/0bd47e39d704c4b19b596512e4be05db4f715e58/sdk/js/src/examples/simpleSearcherLimo.ts#L75) and [Python](https://github.com/pyth-network/per/blob/0bd47e39d704c4b19b596512e4be05db4f715e58/sdk/python/express_relay/searcher/examples/simple_searcher_svm.py#L110).

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Before constructing the bid, make sure your wallet has the required assets.
</Callout>

The bid you construct will look like

```
{
  // serialized transaction object, in base-64 encoding
  transaction: "SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==",
  chain_id: "solana",
  env: "svm"
}
```

where the serialized transaction object should contain an Express Relay `SubmitBid` instruction that specifies the amount you are bidding and the permission details.

### Submit Bids on Opportunities to Express Relay

Searchers can submit their constructed bids to Express Relay via the SDKs, an HTTP POST request, or a WebSocket connection.

The code snippet below demonstrates how to submit a bid using the Typescript SDK:

```typescript {8} copy
const generateBid = async (opportunity: OpportunitySvm, recentBlockhash: Blockhash): BidSvm => {
    ...
}

const handleOpporunity = async (opportunity: Opportunity) => {
    ...
    const bid = await generateBid(opportunity as OpportunitySvm, this.recentBlockhash[this.chainId]);
    await client.submitBid(bid);
}
```

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>

The code snippet below demonstrates how to submit a bid using the Python SDK:

```python {5} copy
import typing

async def generate_bid(opp: OpportunitySvm) -> BidSvm:
    ...

def opportunity_callback(opportunity: Opportunity):
    bid = generate_bid(typing.cast(OpportunitySvm, opportunity))
    await client.submit_bid(bid, subscribe_to_updates=True)
```

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
Searchers can submit bids through an HTTP POST call to the [`/v1/bids`](https://pyth-express-relay-mainnet.asymmetric.re/docs#tag/bid/operation/bid) endpoint. This endpoint accepts a JSON payload containing the details of the bid.

```bash copy
curl -X POST https://pyth-express-relay-mainnet.asymmetric.re/v1/bids \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
    "chain_id": "development-solana",
    "transaction": "SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ=="
}'
```

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>

Searchers can submit bids via Websocket to avoid additional network round-trips and get notified about changes to the bid status.

```bash copy
{
  "id": "1",
  "method": "post_bid",
  "params": {
    "bid": {
      "chain_id": "development-solana",
      "transaction": "SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ=="
    }
  }
}
```

A successful response to a bid submission has the following schema:

```bash copy
{
  "id": "1",                                            // Websocket request id
  "status": "success",
  "result": {
    "id": "beedbeed-b346-4fa1-8fab-2541a9e1872d",       // Bid id
    "status": "OK"
  }
}
```

Consult [`Websocket API reference`](./websocket-api-reference.mdx) for more details.
