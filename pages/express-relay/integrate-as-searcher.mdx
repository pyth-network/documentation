# How to Integrate Express Relay as a Searcher

By integrating with Express Relay, searchers are able to access opportunities from various DeFi protocols via a simple and unified interface.
Opportunities and searcher bids are communicated via the Express Relay server.
The server exposes different endpoints for interaction which can be used directly via HTTP and WebSocket or via one of the SDKS for convenience.

The integration consists of 2 main steps:

- Integrate your searcher service with the [auction server](./integrate-as-searcher/auction-server)
- \[Optional\] Use [OpportunityAdapter](./integrate-as-searcher/opportunity-adapter) and setup a wallet with the necessary tokens and approvals
