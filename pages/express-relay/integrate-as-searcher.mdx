# How to Integrate Express Relay as a Searcher

Express Relay allows searchers to integrate once and access all existing and future opportunities across integrated DeFi protocols.
Searchers **bid** on these opportunities exposed by Express Relay.

Express Relay exposes different endpoints for interaction, which can be used directly via HTTP, WebSocket, or one of the SDKs for convenience.

Searchers can integrate with Express Relay in three steps:

1. Subscribe to new opportunities
2. Construct the bid
3. Submit the bid to Express Relay.

Searchers can integrate with Express Relay on Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) chains.
