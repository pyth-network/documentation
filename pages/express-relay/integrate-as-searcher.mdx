# How to Integrate Express Relay as a Searcher

Express Relay allows searchers to integrate once and access all existing and future opportunities across integrated DeFi protocols.
Searchers **bid** on these opportunities exposed by Express Relay.

Express Relay exposes different endpoints for interaction, which can be used directly via HTTP, WebSocket, or one of the SDKs for convenience.

Searchers can integrate with Express Relay in three steps:

1. Subscribe to new opportunities
2. Construct the bid
3. Submit the bid to Express Relay.

<Steps>

### Subscribe to New Opportunities

Express Relay provides searchers with [Typescript](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/express_relay/sdk/js) and [Python](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/express_relay/sdk/python) SDKs to interact with Express Relay.
Searchers can also directly fetch available opportunities via HTTP or subscribe to them via WebSocket.

<Tabs items={['Typescript', 'Python', 'HTTP', 'Websocket']}>

<Tabs.Tab>
Pyth provides a Typescript SDK, which allows searchers to subscribe to opportunities:

```typescript
import { Client, Opportunity } from "@pythnetwork/express-relay-evm-js";

const handleOpporunity = async (opportunity: Opportunity) => {
  // Implement your opportunity handler here
};

const client = new Client(
  { baseUrl: "https://pyth-express-relay-mainnet.asymmetric.re" },
  undefined, // Default WebSocket options
  handleOpporunity
);
await client.subscribeChains(["op_sepolia"]);
```

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
Pyth provides a Python SDK, which allows searchers to subscribe to opportunities:

```python copy
from express_relay.client import (
    ExpressRelayClient,
)
from express_relay.express_relay_types import Opportunity

def opportunity_callback(opportunity: Opportunity):
    # Implement your opportunity handler here
    pass

client = ExpressRelayClient(
    'server_url',
    None,
    opportunity_callback,
    None,
)
await client.subscribe_chains(['op_sepolia'])
```

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
Searchers can request opportunities through an HTTP **GET** call to the [`/v1/opportunities`](https://pyth-express-relay-mainnet.asymmetric.re/redoc#tag/opportunity/operation/get_opportunities) endpoint.

```bash copy
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://pyth-express-relay-mainnet.asymmetric.re/v1/opportunities?chain_id=op_sepolia&mode=live'
```

Opportunities are short-lived and could be executed in a matter of seconds. So, the above endpoint could return an empty response.

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
Searchers can connect to the server via WebSocket to reduce latency and subscribe to various events. The WebSocket endpoint lives at `/v1/ws`(e.g `wss://pyth-express-relay-mainnet.asymmetric.re/v1/ws`).
Here is a sample JSON payload to subscribe to opportunities:

```bash copy
{
  "id": "1",
  "method": "subscribe",
  "params": {
    "chain_ids": ["op_sepolia"]
  }
}
```

Consult [`Websocket API reference`](./websocket-api-reference.mdx) for a complete list of methods and parameters.

The server responds with opportunities in the following format:

```bash copy
{
  "target_calldata": "0xdeadbeef",                                      // Calldata to execute the opportunity
  "chain_id": "op_sepolia",
  "target_contract": "0xcA11bde05977b3631167028862bE2a173976CA11",      // Protocol contract address to call
  "permission_key": "0xcafebabe",                                       // Unique identifier for the opportunity
  "target_call_value": "1",                                             // Value (in Wei) to send to the protocol contract.
  "sell_tokens": [                                                      // Tokens the protocol expects to receive
    {
      "amount": "900",
      "token": "0x2260fac5e5542a773aa44fbcfedf7c193bc2c599"
    }
  ],
  "buy_tokens": [                                                       // Tokens the protocol will send in return
    {
      "amount": "1000",
      "token": "0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2"
    }
  ],
  "version": "v1"                                                       // Opportunity format version
}
```

### Construct the Bid

Searchers should construct a bid by evaluating the fetched opportunity.
The SDKs provide an easy way to construct a bid using the [`OpportunityAdapter`](https://github.com/pyth-network/per/blob/main/contracts/src/opportunity-adapter/OpportunityAdapter.sol) contract.
The `OpportunityAdapter` contract handles asset transfers and ensures the opportunity is executed correctly.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Before constructing the bid, make sure your wallet has the required assets and
  has made the necessary approvals. Refer to the [Prepare assets for Opportunity
  Adapter](./integrate-as-searcher/opportunity-adapter.mdx) section for more
  details.
</Callout>

Here is an example of how to construct a bid object using `OpportunityAdapter` via the SDKs:

<Tabs items={['Typescript', 'Python']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```typescript copy
const handleOpportunity = async (opportunity: Opportunity) => {
    const nonce = BigInt(Math.floor(Math.random() * 2 ** 50));
    const privateKey = `0x0000`; // Private key of the searcher
    const bidAmount = BigInt(1000); // The bidAmount should be determined based on opportunity
    const deadline = BigInt(Math.round(Date.now() / 1000 + 60)) // Bid is valid for a minute
    const bid = await client.signBid(opportunity, {bidAmount, nonce, deadline}, privateKey)
}
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```python copy
from datetime import datetime

from express_relay.client import (
ExpressRelayClient,
sign_bid
)
from secrets import randbits
from express_relay.express_relay_types import Opportunity, OpportunityBidParams

def opportunity_callback(opportunity: Opportunity):
nonce = randbits(64)
deadline = datetime.utcnow().timestamp() + 60 # Bid is valid for a minute
bid_amount = 1000 # The bid_amount should be determined based on the opportunity
private_key = '0x00000' # Private key of the searcher
signed_bid = sign_bid(opportunity,
OpportunityBidParams(amount=bid_amount, deadline=int(deadline), nonce=nonce),
private_key)

````
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>




If you prefer to use your custom contracts instead of the `OpportunityAdapter`, please refer to the [custom contracts](./integrate-as-searcher/custom-contract.mdx) section.

### Submit Bids on Opportunities to Express Relay

Searchers can submit the constructed bids to Express Relay via the SDKs, an HTTP POST request, or a WebSocket connection.

<Tabs items={['Typescript', 'Python', 'HTTP', 'Websocket']}>

<Tabs.Tab>

The code snippet below demonstrates how to submit a bid using the Typescript SDK:

```typescript {4} copy
const handleOpporunity = async (opportunity: Opportunity) => {
    ...
    const bid = await client.signBid(opportunity, {amount, nonce, deadline}, privateKey)
    await client.submitBid(bid)
}
````

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>

The code snippet below demonstrates how to submit a bid using the Python SDK:

```python {5} copy
def opportunity_callback(opportunity: Opportunity):
    signed_bid = sign_bid(opportunity,
                          OpportunityBidParams(amount=amount, deadline=int(deadline), nonce=nonce),
                          private_key)
    await client.submit_bid(signed_bid, subscribe_to_updates=True)
```

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
Searchers can submit bids through an HTTP POST call to the [`/v1/bids`](https://pyth-express-relay-mainnet.asymmetric.re/redoc#tag/bid/operation/bid) endpoint. This endpoint accepts a JSON payload containing the details of the bid.

```bash copy
curl -X POST https://pyth-express-relay-mainnet.asymmetric.re/v1/bids \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
    "chain_id": "op_sepolia",
    "permission_key": "0x000000000000000000000000",
    "target_contract": "0x87ee27c5ae396b28a825968b277fece0720f5907",
    "target_calldata": "0xeadb38050000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000064",
    "amount": "10"
}'
```

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>

Searchers can submit bids via Websocket to avoid additional network round-trips and get notified about changes to the bid status.

```bash copy
{
  "id": "1",
  "method": "post_bid",
  "params": {
    "bid": {
      "chain_id": "op_sepolia",
      "permission_key": "0x000000000000000000000000",
      "target_contract": "0x87ee27c5ae396b28a825968b277fece0720f5907",
      "target_calldata": "0xeadb38050000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000064",
      "amount": "10"
    }
  }
}
```

A successful response to a bid submission has the following schema:

```bash copy
{
  "id": "1",                                            // Websocket request id
  "status": "success",
  "result": {
    "id": "beedbeed-b346-4fa1-8fab-2541a9e1872d",       // Bid id
    "status": "OK"
  }
}
```
