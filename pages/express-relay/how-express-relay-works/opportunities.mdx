# Opportunities

In the context of Express Relay, an opportunity refers to a potential transaction that a searcher can execute on a protocol. Typically, the term "opportunity" is used for such transactions that are lucrative and therefore hotly contested by many searchers. 

In the pre-Express Relay world, opportunities therefore correspond to MEV: a protocol generates MEV when an opportunity appears on that protocol and searchers bid up the right to execute the opportunity at the validator level.

In the context of Express Relay, the value deriving from an opportunity no longer flows to the validator but instead is recaptured by the system and shared back with the protocol. In Express Relay, protocols expose opportunities to the network of integrated searchers, and the searchers then bid on priority to execute those opportunities. Critically, the auction has moved from being determined by validators to a lower level at the protocol level.
