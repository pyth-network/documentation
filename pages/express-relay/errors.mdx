| Error                         | Explanation                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FeeSplitLargerThanPrecision` | The proposed fee split is invalid (split is larger than `FEE_SPLIT_PRECISION`, 10000)                    |
| `FeesHigherThanBid`           | The fees to pay out exceed the value of the bid amount.                                                  |
| `DeadlinePassed`              | The bid is no longer valid, as the Unix time deadline has passed.                                        |
| `InvalidCPISubmitBid`         | The `SubmitBid` instruction should not be called via CPI.                                                |
| `MissingPermission`           | The transaction is missing a `SubmitBid` instruction with the matching permission key.                   |
| `MultiplePermissions`         | The transaction should not contain more than one `SubmitBid` instruction.                                |

| `InsufficientRent`            | The fee splits received by different parties must be sufficient to cover the account rent.               |

| `InsufficientUserFunds`       | The user lacks the funds to pay the specified amount in the swap instruction.                            |
