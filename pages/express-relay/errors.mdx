# Error Codes

The following table lists the error codes and their explanations for [`ExpressRelay`](https://github.com/pyth-network/per/blob/main/contracts/src/express-relay/ExpressRelay.sol) and [`OpportunityAdapter`](https://github.com/pyth-network/per/blob/main/contracts/src/opportunity-adapter/OpportunityAdapter.sol) contracts.
