# How to Integrate Express Relay as a Protocol

This guide explains how to integrate Express Relay as a protocol.
To integrate Express Relay as a protocol, you need to: 

- Update the protocol's contract to **permission** Express Relay transactions.
- Write a script to **expose** liquidation opportunities to Searchers for auction.

## Update the Protocol's Contract

Express Relay requires the protocol's contract to permit Express Relay to access liquidation. 

<Steps>
### Install the Express Relay SDK

Pyth provides a [Solidity SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pythnetwork/express-relay-sdk-solidity) to help you integrate Express Relay into your protocol. 
The SDK exposes `IExpressRelay` and `IExpressRelayFeeReceiver` interfaces to interact with Express Relay.

#### Truffle/Hardhat

If you are using Truffle or Hardhat, you can install the SDK using npm:

```bash copy
npm install @pythnetwork/express-relay-sdk-solidity
```
#### Foundry

If you are using Foundry, you must create an NPM project if you don't already have one. From the root directory of your project, run:

```bash copy
npm init -y
npm install @pythnetwork/express-relay-sdk-solidity
```

Then add the following line to `remappings.txt` file:

```text copy
@pythnetwork/express-relay-sdk-solidity/=node_modules/@pythnetwork/express-relay-sdk-solidity
```

### Modifying the Protocol's Contract

The protocol's contract should be updated to:

1. Utilize `isPermissioned` method from `IExpressRelay` interface to **permit** Express Relay transactions.
1. Implement the `IExpressRelayFeeReceiver` interface to receive funds from Express Relay.

#### 1. Permit Express Relay Transactions

The `isPermissioned` function takes two arguments:
1. `protocolFeeReceiver`: The address of the protocol's contract.
1. `permissionId`: A unique identifier for the liquidation opportunity.

```solidity copy
import "@pythnetwork/express-relay-sdk-solidity/IExpressRelay.sol";

// Express Relay contract address on Optimism Sepolia
// Check {INSERT CONTRACT ADDRESS PAGE LINK} for the address deployed on other networks
address expressRelay = 0xD6e417287b875A3932c1Ff5dcB26D4D2C8b90B40;

require(
		IExpressRelay(expressRelay).isPermissioned(
        protocolFeeReceiver,
        permissionId
    ),
		"invalid liquidation"
);
```


#### 2. Set up Fee Receiver

The `IExpressRelayFeeReceiver` interface requires the protocol's contract to implement the `receiveAuctionProceedings` function. The Express Relay server calls this function to send funds to the protocol's contract.

```solidity copy
interface IExpressRelayFeeReceiver {
 function receiveAuctionProceedings(
        bytes calldata permissionKey
    ) external payable;
}
```






The following code snippet shows a sample liquidation method and updates to the protocol's contract to permit Express Relay transactions:

```solidity showLineNumbers {1,2,12,14,39-43} copy
import "@pythnetwork/express-relay-sdk-solidity/IExpressRelay.sol";
import "@pythnetwork/express-relay-sdk-solidity/IExpressRelayFeeReceiver.sol";

struct Vault {
    address tokenCollateral;
    address tokenDebt;
    uint256 amountCollateral;
    uint256 amountDebt;
    uint256 minHealthRatio;
}

contract EasyLend is IExpressRelayFeeReceiver {

    address public immutable expressRelay;

    constructor(
    address expressRelayAddress,
    address oracleAddress,
    bool allowUndercollateralized
    ){
    _nVaults = 0;
    expressRelay = expressRelayAddress;
    _oracle = oracleAddress;
    _allowUndercollateralized = allowUndercollateralized;
    }

    /**
    * @notice liquidate function - liquidates a vault
    * @param vaultID: ID of the vault to be liquidated
    */
    function liquidate(uint256 vaultID) public {
        Vault memory vault = _vaults[vaultID];
        uint256 vaultHealth = _getVaultHealth(vault);
        // Proceed only if the vault health is below the minimum health ratio
        if (vaultHealth >= vault.minHealthRatio) {
            revert InvalidLiquidation();
        }

        // Check if the liquidation is permissioned
        bool permissioned = IExpressRelay(payable(expressRelay)).isPermissioned(
            address(this),
            abi.encode(vaultID) // vault id uniquely represents the opportunity and can be used as permission id
            );
        require(permissioned, "invalid liquidation");
    
        IERC20(vault.tokenDebt).transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),vault.amountDebt);
        IERC20(vault.tokenCollateral).transfer(msg.sender,vault.amountCollateral);
    
        _vaults[vaultID].amountCollateral = 0;
        _vaults[vaultID].amountDebt = 0;
    }

    /**
     * @notice receiveAuctionProceedings function - receives the native token from the express relay
     * You can use the permission key to distribute the received funds to users who got liquidated, LPs, etc...
     *
     * @param permissionKey: permission key that was used for the auction
     */
    function receiveAuctionProceedings(
        bytes calldata permissionKey
    ) external payable {
        emit VaultReceivedETH(msg.sender, msg.value, permissionKey);
    }

}
```
</Steps>


## Expose Liquidation Opportunities to Searchers

Protocols must fetch liquidation opportunities like vaults and positions eligible for liquidation and expose them to Express Relay for auction.

The Express Relay auction server provides a POST method, `/v1/opportunities`, which accepts a JSON payload containing the details of the liquidation opportunity.

The JSON payload should contain liquidation opportunities in the following format:

```json
{
  "target_calldata": "0xdeadbeef",                                      // Calldata to perform liquidation
  "chain_id": "op_sepolia",                                             
  "target_contract": "0xcA11bde05977b3631167028862bE2a173976CA11",      // Protocol contract address to call for liquidation
  "permission_key": "0xcafebabe",                                       // Unique identifier for the liquidation opportunity
  "target_call_value": "1",                                             // Value(in Wei) to send with to the protocol contract.
  "buy_tokens": [                                                       // Tokens to buy (Collateral)
    {
      "amount": "1000",
      "token": "0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2"
    }
  ],
  "sell_tokens": [                                                      // Tokens to sell (Oustadaing Debt)
    {
      "amount": "900",
      "token": "0x2260fac5e5542a773aa44fbcfedf7c193bc2c599"
    }
  ],
  "version": "v1"                                                       // Opportunity format version
}
```
