# Introduction

Express Relay is a priority auction that enables protocols to eliminate maximal extractable value (MEV).

**For Protocol Developers:** Express Relayâ€™s auction primitive allows your protocol to prioritize access to permissionless operations, eliminating the extractive role of miners in ordering transactions.
A network of established searchers compete in the auctions, allowing you to avoid spending time and energy bootstrapping your own protocol-specific searcher network.

**For Searchers:** Express Relay aggregates liquidation and other MEV opportunities across integrated DeFi protocols, providing easy and unified access.
