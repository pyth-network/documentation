# Introduction

Express Relay is a priority auction that enables protocols to eliminate [Maximal Extractable Value](https://www.ledger.com/academy/glossary/maximal-extractable-value-mev) (MEV).

- **For Protocol Developers:** Express Relay allows protocols to recapture MEV and access a network of searchers. 
With Express Relay, protocols don't need to spend time and energy bootstrapping a protocol-specific searcher network.

- **For Searchers:** Express Relay provides easy and unified access by aggregating liquidation and other MEV opportunities across integrated DeFi protocols. 
Searchers integrate once and gain access to all existing and future opportunities. 

## Integration

To integrate with Express Relay, you can integrate as a protocol or as a searcher.
