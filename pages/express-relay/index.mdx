# Introduction

Express Relay is a priority auction which enables better orderflow mechanisms that eliminate [Maximal Extractable Value](https://www.ledger.com/academy/glossary/maximal-extractable-value-mev) (MEV).

- **For Protocol Developers:** Express Relay allows protocols to recapture MEV and access a network of searchers for more competitive pricing than on-chain sources provide.
  With Express Relay, protocols get access to plug-and-play liquidity.

- **For Searchers:** Express Relay provides easy and unified access to a range of orderflow opportunities across integrated DeFi protocols.
