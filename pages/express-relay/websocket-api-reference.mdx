# WebSocket API Reference

Searchers can connect to the server via WebSocket to reduce latency and subscribe to various events.
The WebSocket endpoint lives at `/v1/ws`(e.g `wss://pyth-express-relay-mainnet.asymmetric.re/v1/ws`).

## General format

Each request sent to the server via WebSocket should be in the following JSON format:

```json copy
{
	"id": "...", // used for uniquely identifying the response to this request
	"method": "...", // name of the server method to invoke
	"params": {...} // parameters necessary for the method
}
```

The server responds using the same `id` specified in the request:

```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "status": "success",
  "result": {}
}
```

In case of error, the `status` field will be `error`, and the error message will be available in the `result` field as a string:

```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "status": "error",
  "result": "..."
}
```

## Subscribing to opportunities

To subscribe to opportunities, you can send a request using the `chain_ids` parameter, which specifies the chains as an array.

```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "method": "subscribe",
  "params": {
    "chain_ids": ["op_sepolia"]
  }
}
```

After a successful subscription, you will receive new opportunities for the selected chains via the WebSocket in the following format:

```json
{
	"type": "new_opportunity",
	"opportunity": {...}
}
```

The schema for the opportunity is similar to whatâ€™s returned in the [HTTP requests](https://pyth-express-relay-mainnet.asymmetric.re/docs#tag/opportunity/operation/get_opportunities)

To unsubscribe from a list of chains, you can send the following message:

```json copy
{
  "id": "1",
  "method": "unsubscribe",
  "params": {
    "chain_ids": ["op_sepolia"]
  }
}
```

## Submitting bids

In addition to the HTTP methods, you can submit your bids via WebSocket in order to avoid additional network round trips and get notified about changes to your bid status.
Here is an example JSON payload for submitting a new bid:

<Tabs items={['EVM', 'SVM']}>

<Tabs.Tab>

```json copy
{
  "id": "1",
  "method": "post_bid",
  "params": {
    "bid": {
      "amount": "10",
      "calldata": "0xdeadbeef",
      "chain_id": "op_sepolia",
      "contract": "0xcA11bde05977b3631167028862bE2a173976CA11",
      "permission_key": "0xcafebabe"
    }
  }
}
```

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>

```json copy
{
  "id": "1",
  "method": "post_bid",
  "params": {
    "bid": {
      "chain_id": "development-solana",
      "transaction": "SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ=="
    }
  }
}
```

</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

A successful response to a bid submission has the following schema:

```json
{
  "id": "1", // WebSocket request id
  "status": "success",
  "result": {
    "id": "beedbeed-b346-4fa1-8fab-2541a9e1872d", // bid id
    "status": "OK"
  }
}
```

After submitting your bid via WebSocket, you will receive notifications about the bid status updates in JSON format.
Refer to the examples below, one for each of the status options in EVM and SVM:

<Tabs items={[`EVM`, `SVM`]}>

<Tabs.Tab>
	<Tabs items={[`pending`, `submitted`, `lost`, `won`]}>
	<Tabs.Tab>

	}
	```
	</Tabs.Tab>
	<Tabs.Tab>

			}
		}
	}
	```
	</Tabs.Tab>
	<Tabs.Tab>
	```json
	// lost
	// The bid lost the auction, which is concluded with the transaction with the given hash and index

## Connection Persistence

The WebSocket server responds to ping messages according to WebSocket standards.

Additionally, the server periodically sends a ping message to the client to ensure the connection is still active and expects a pong in return.
