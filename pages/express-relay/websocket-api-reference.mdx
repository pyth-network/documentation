# WebSocket API Reference

Searchers can connect to the server via WebSocket to reduce latency and subscribe to various events.
The WebSocket endpoint lives at `/v1/ws`(e.g `wss://per-mainnet.dourolabs.app/v1/ws`).

## General format

Each request sent to the server via WebSocket should be in the following JSON format:

```json copy
{
	"id": "...", // used for uniquely identifying the response to this request
	"method": "...", // name of the server method to invoke
	"params": {...} // parameters necessary for the method
}
```

The server responds using the same `id` specified in the request:

```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "status": "success",
  "result": {}
}
```

In case of error, the `status` field will be `error`, and the error message will be available in the `result` field as a string:

```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "status": "error",
  "result": "..."
}
```

## Subscribing to opportunities

To subscribe to opportunities, you can send a request using the `chain_ids` parameter, which specifies the chains as an array.

```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "method": "subscribe",
  "params": {
    "chain_ids": ["development-solana"]
  }
}
```

After a successful subscription, you will receive new opportunities for the selected chains via the WebSocket in the following format:

```json
{
	"type": "new_opportunity",
	"opportunity": {...}
}
```

The schema for the opportunity is similar to what’s returned in the [HTTP requests](https://per-mainnet.dourolabs.app/docs#tag/opportunity/operation/get_opportunities).

To unsubscribe from a list of chains, you can send the following message:

```json copy
{
  "id": "1",
  "method": "unsubscribe",
  "params": {
    "chain_ids": ["development-solana"]
  }
}
```

## Submitting bids

In addition to the HTTP methods, you can submit your bids via WebSocket in order to avoid additional network round trips and get notified about changes to your bid status.
Here is an example JSON payload for submitting a new bid:

```json copy
{
  "id": "1",
  "method": "post_bid",
  "params": {
    "bid": {
      "chain_id": "development-solana",
      "transaction": "SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ=="
    }
  }
}
```

A successful response to a bid submission has the following schema:

```json
{
  "id": "1", // WebSocket request id
  "status": "success",
  "result": {
    "id": "beedbeed-b346-4fa1-8fab-2541a9e1872d", // bid id
    "status": "OK"
  }
}
```

After submitting your bid via WebSocket, you will receive notifications about the bid status updates in JSON format.
Refer to the examples below:

<Tabs items={[`pending`, `submitted`, `lost`, `won`, `failed`, `expired`]}>
	<Tabs.Tab>
	```json
	// pending
	// The temporary state which means the auction for this bid is pending.
	// It will be updated to Lost or Submitted after the auction takes place.
	{
		"type": "bid_status_update",
		"status": {
			"id": "beedbeed-0e42-400f-a8ef-d78aa5422252",
			"bid_status": {
				"type": "pending"
			}
		}
	}
	```
	</Tabs.Tab>
	<Tabs.Tab>
	```json
	// submitted
	// The bid won the auction and was submitted to the chain, with the signature of the corresponding transaction provided in the result field.
	// This state is temporary and will be updated to either Won or Failed after the transaction is included in a block, or Expired if the transaction expires before it is included.
	{
		"type": "bid_status_update",
		"status": {
			"id": "beedbeed-0e42-400f-a8ef-d78aa5422252",

		}
	}
	```
	</Tabs.Tab>
	<Tabs.Tab>
	```json
	// lost
	// The bid lost the auction.
	// This bid status will have a result field containing the signature of the transaction corresponding to the winning bid,
	// unless the auction had no winner (because all bids were found to be invalid).
	{
		"type": "bid_status_update",
		"status": {

	<Tabs.Tab>

## Prioritization Fees

For SVM chains, you will also receive `svm_chain_update` messages which include recent prioritization fee estimates needed for your transactions to land on chain. These prioritization fees will be specified in microlamports per compute unit; refer to [Solana docs](https://solana.com/developers/guides/advanced/how-to-use-priority-fees) to learn more about prioritization fees. The format for these updates is:

```json
{
  "type": "svm_chain_update",
  "update": {
    "chain_id": "solana",
    "blockhash": "PTgMRAF9GXRvYnWnpmDcX9gc1zesYV37kDjrax8kz3o",
    "latest_prioritization_fee": 1000
  }
}
```

## Connection Persistence

The WebSocket server responds to ping messages according to WebSocket standards.

Additionally, the server periodically sends a ping message to the client to ensure the connection is still active and expects a pong in return.
