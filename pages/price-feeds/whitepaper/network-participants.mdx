# Network Participants

2 different types of stakeholders will interact within the network:

- **Publishers** publish price feeds and earn fees in exchange. Publishers are typically market participants with access to accurate and timely price information.
- **Consumers** read price feeds and incorporate data into smart contracts or dApps. In the process, consumers pay fees to the protocol to access the data. Fees are charged at a fixed rate per Pyth price update on a target chain â€“ e.g., 0.0001 ETH per update. Consumers are users of on-chain protocols that integrate Pyth for market data. These protocols may be running on various blockchains.

Any actor may have multiple roles within the network.
