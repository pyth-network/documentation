# Sponsored Feeds

The Pyth Data Association sponsors price updates for some feeds on some networks.
Sponsored feeds are updated at a specific heartbeat rate or when the price changes by a specific percentage.
Developers don't need to [pull prices](./fetch-price-updates.mdx) for sponsored feeds, unless they required short update intervals.

The sponsored feeds can vary by network. Please see the relevant section below for the network of interest.

- [EVM](sponsored-feeds/evm)
- [Solana](sponsored-feeds/solana)
- [Aptos](sponsored-feeds/aptos)
- [Sui](sponsored-feeds/sui)

If you would like to see additional feeds on this list, please fill in this [form](https://tally.so/r/nGz2jj) to signal your interest.
