# Introduction

Pyth Network price feeds publish financial market data to multiple blockchains.
Pyth's market data is contributed by over 95 [first-party publishers](https://pyth.network/publishers/), including some of the biggest exchanges and market making firms in the world.
The protocol offers price feeds for a number of different asset classes, including [US equities, commodities, and cryptocurrencies](https://pyth.network/price-feeds/).
Each price feed publishes a [robust aggregate](price-feeds/how-pyth-works/price-aggregation.md) of publisher prices that updates multiple times per second.

Price feeds are available on multiple blockchains and can also be used in off-chain applications.
Pyth offers two different versions of price feeds:

- [Solana Price Feeds](price-feeds/solana-price-feeds.md) provide real-time prices on Solana mainnet.
- [Pythnet Price Feeds](price-feeds/pythnet-price-feeds.md) provide real-time prices for 40+ blockchain ecosystems.
  They are available in mainnet for most [EVM chains](price-feeds/use-real-time-data/evm.md) -- including Ethereum, BNB, Avalanche, and more --
  several [Cosmos chains](price-feeds/use-real-time-data/cosmwasm.md), [Aptos](price-feeds/use-real-time-data/aptos.md), [Sui](price-feeds/use-real-time-data/sui.md), and [NEAR](price-feeds/use-real-time-data/near.md).
  More ecosystems are coming soon!

Developers may also consider using [Benchmarks](../benchmarks) to access historical Pyth prices for both on- and off-chain use.
These historical prices can be used for settlement or other similar applications.
