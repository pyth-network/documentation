# Troubleshoot Price Feeds

This guide is designed to help you troubleshoot common issues you may encounter when using Pyth Price Feeds.
Follow the steps provided below to diagnose and resolve the issue.


## Common Issues



### On-chain Price Feed Issues

#### Issue: getPrice() returns StalePrice() or `0x19abf40e` error

This error occurs when the price data of the requested asset has not been updated in the last valid time period.
The valid time period for the feed can queried using the [`getValidTime()`](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/blob/main/target_chains/ethereum/sdk/solidity/AbstractPyth.sol#L22) method.

To resolve this issue: 

1. Update the price data by calling [`updatePriceFeeds()`]("https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/blob/main/target_chains/ethereum/sdk/solidity/AbstractPyth.sol#L88") 
by passing the latest updateData from [Hermes](https://hermes.pyth.network/docs/#/rest/latest_vaas).
2. If the latest price data is not necessary, use the [`getPriceUnsafe()`](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/blob/main/target_chains/ethereum/sdk/solidity/AbstractPyth.sol#L41)
method to get the price data. If the price feed is available, the method will returnt the latest price data with timestamp of last update.


#### Issue: getPrice() returns PriceFeedNotFound() or `0x14aebe68` error

This error occurs when the requested price has not been published on the respective chain.
Double check the entered [price feed ids](https://pyth.network/developers/price-feed-ids) and [pyth-contract addresses](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/contract-addresses/evm) to make sure they are correct.
