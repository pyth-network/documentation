# Pythnet Price Feeds

Pythnet price feeds use a "pull" price update model, where users are responsible for posting price updates on-chain when needed.
Please see [_Pull Updates_](pythnet-price-feeds/on-demand.md) to learn more about this model and what this means for integrators.

In the pull model, developers should integrate Pyth into both their on-chain and off-chain code:

1. On-chain programs should read prices from the Pyth program deployed on the same chain
2. Off-chain frontends and jobs should include Pyth price updates alongside (or within) their application-specific transactions.

Pyth provides ecosystem-specific SDKs to assist with both the on- and off-chain pieces of the integration.
The easiest way to use Pyth price feeds is to integrate the appropriate SDKs into your application.
Before getting started with an SDK, please read [_Using Price Feeds_](solana-price-feeds/best-practices.md) to understand how Pyth price feeds are represented, and to learn best practices to use Pyth prices safely and correctly.
