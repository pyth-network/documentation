# Getting Started

Integrating Pyth price feeds is quick and easy. Pyth price feeds are permissionless and available on-chain. You **don't** need to sign up or request an API key

Pyth offers several different resources to help you get started.
The Build section provides resources for developers integrating Pyth price feeds into their applications.
The Learn section provides general meterial for anyone interested in understanding how the protocol works.

## Build

Developers interested in using Pyth can refer to the following resources:

- [Create-your-first-pyth-app](./create-your-first-pyth-app/) is a tutorial that walks the reader through all of the steps required to develop, test and deploy a contract using Pyth price feeds. This guide is tailored toward new developers with less contract development experience.
- [User-real-time-data](./use-real-time-data/) is a how-to guide that provides the minimal steps to integrate price feeds into your app. This guide is targeted towards more experienced developers who know the basics of smart contract development.

In addition to the two guides above, the following resources will be useful for developers as they integrate:

- [API-reference](./api-reference.mdx) provides a detailed overview of Pyth's on-chain methods.
- [Price Feed Ids](./price-feed-ids.mdx) list the price feed ids for all the assets supported by Pyth.
- [Contract-addresses](./contract-addresses/) provides the contract addresses for Pyth on different chains.
- [Best-practices](./best-practices.mdx) to use Pyth price feeds safely and effectively in your application.

## Learn

For those interested in learning more about Pyth, the following resources are available:

- [How-pyth-works](./how-pyth-works.mdx) provides a high-level overview of Pyth architecture.
