# Pyth on Aptos

Aptos contracts can update and fetch the Pyth prices using the Pyth Aptos Contract, which has been deployed on Mainnet. The documented source code can be found [here](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/blob/main/target_chains/aptos/contracts/sources/pyth.move).

## Updating Price Feeds

The mechanism by which price feeds are updated on Aptos is explained [here](./pythnet-price-feeds.md). The [pyth-aptos-js](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/aptos/sdk/js) package can be used to fetch price feed update data which can be passed to the `pyth::update_price` on-chain function.

## Example Applications

- [Minimal on-chain contract](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/blob/main/target_chains/aptos/examples/fetch_btc_price/sources/example.move) which updates and returns the Pyth BTC/USD price.
- [Full-stack React app and on-chain contract](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/aptos/examples/mint_nft) which uses the [pyth-aptos-js](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/aptos/sdk/js) package to update the price used by the contract.

## Contract Addresses

Developers will need the address of the Pyth price feed contract on their blockchain in order to use Pyth.
Please consult [Aptos Contract Addresses](../contract-addresses/aptos) to find the address for your blockchain.
