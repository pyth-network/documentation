# Off-chain Applications

Pyth provides a [typescript SDK client](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/price_service/client/js) to read the values of Pyth Price feeds in off-chain applications.
This guide explains how to use the Pyth SDK to fetch the latest prices, and how to subscribe to price updates.

## Installation

The Pyth SDK can be installed using npm or yarn.

### npm

```
npm install --save @pythnetwork/price-service-client
```

### Yarn

```
yarn add @pythnetwork/price-service-client
```

## Usage

Typical usage of the Pyth SDK involves creating a client instance, and using it to fetch prices.

```typescript
const connection = new PriceServiceConnection("https://hermes.pyth.network", {
  priceFeedRequestConfig: {
    // Provide this option to retrieve signed price updates for on-chain contracts.
    binary: true,
  },
});

const priceIds = [
  "0xe62df6c8b4a85fe1a67db44dc12de5db330f7ac66b72dc658afedf0f4a415b43", // BTC/USD price id
  "0xff61491a931112ddf1bd8147cd1b641375f79f5825126d665480874634fd0ace", // ETH/USD price id
];

// Get the latest values of the price feeds as JSON objects.
// If you set `binary: true` above, then this method also returns signed price updates for the on-chain Pyth contract.
const currentPrices = await connection.getLatestPriceFeeds(priceIds);
```

You can also subscribe to real-time price updates over a WebSocket connection using the `subscribePriceFeedUpdates` method.

```typescript
connection.subscribePriceFeedUpdates(priceIds, (priceFeed) => {
  // priceFeed here is the same as returned by getLatestPriceFeeds above.
  // It will include signed price updates if the binary option is provided to the connection constructor.
  console.log(
    `Received an update for ${priceFeed.id}: ${priceFeed.getPriceNoOlderThan(
      60
    )}`
  );
});

// When using the subscription, make sure to close the WebSocket upon termination to finish the process gracefully.
setTimeout(() => {
  connection.closeWebSocket();
}, 60000);
```
