# How to Use Real-Time Data in Solana Programs

This guide explains how to use real-time Pyth data in EVM programs.

## Install Pyth SDKs

We provide two SDKs for Solana applications to cover the on- and off-chain portions of the integration:

### Rust SDK

The [pyth-solana-receiver-sdk crate](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/solana/pyth_solana_receiver_sdk) can be used to consume Pyth prices inside Solana programs written in Rust.
Add this crate to the dependencies section of your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml copy
[dependencies]
pyth-solana-receiver-sdk ="0.1.0"
```

### Typescript SDK

Pyth provides two Typescript packages, [@pythnetwork/price-service-client](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/price_service/client/js) and [@pythnetwork/pyth-solana-receiver](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/solana/sdk/js/pyth_solana_receiver), for fetching Pyth prices and submitting them to the blockchain respectively.
Add these packages to your off-chain dependencies:

```bash copy
npm install --save @pythnetwork/price-service-client @pythnetwork/pyth-solana-receiver
```

## Write Contract Code

Add code to your Solana program to read the Pyth price.
Pyth prices are posted to price update accounts that can be passed to any instruction that needs price data.
If you are using Anchor, you can simply add an `Account<'info, PriceUpdateV2>` field to your `Context` struct:

TODO: does this Account thing perform the necessary account ownership checks?

```rust copy
#[derive(Accounts)]
#[instruction()]
pub struct Sample<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub payer: Signer<'info>,
    // Add this account to any instruction Context that needs price data.
    pub price_update: Account<'info, PriceUpdateV2>,
}
```

Next, update the instruction logic to read the price from the price update account:

```rust copy
pub fn sample(ctx: Context<Sample>) -> Result<()> {
    let price_update = &mut ctx.accounts.price_update;
    // get_price_no_older_than will fail if the price update is more than 30 seconds old
    const maximum_age: u64 = 30;
    // get_price_no_older_than will fail if the price update is for a different price feed.
    // This string is the id of the BTC/USD feed. See https://pyth.network/developers/price-feed-ids for all available ids.
    const feed_id: FeedId = get_feed_id_from_hex("0xe62df6c8b4a85fe1a67db44dc12de5db330f7ac66b72dc658afedf0f4a415b43")?;
    let price = price_update.get_price_no_older_than(&Clock::get()?, maximum_age, &feed_id)?;
    // TODO log something about the price here
}
```

Note that it is your responsibility in this function to validate that the provided price update is for the appropriate price feed and timestamp.
`PriceUpdateV2` guarantees that the account contains a verified price for _some_ price feed at _some_ point in time.
There are various methods on this struct (such as `get_price_no_older_than`) that you can use to implement the necessary checks.

## Write Frontend Code

Your frontend code needs to perform two different tasks:

1. Fetch price updates from Hermes
2. Post the price updates to Solana and invoke your application logic

### Fetch price updates

Use `PriceServiceConnection` from `@pythnetwork/price-service-client` to fetch Pyth price updates from Hermes:

```typescript copy
import { PriceServiceConnection } from "@pythnetwork/price-service-client";

// The URL below is a public Hermes instance operated by the Pyth Data Association.
// Hermes is also available from several third party providers listed here:
// https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/api-instances-and-providers/hermes
const priceServiceConnection = new PriceServiceConnection(
  "https://hermes.pyth.network/",
  { priceFeedRequestConfig: { binary: true } }
);

// TODO: illustrate expected contents of this string
const priceUpdateData: string[] = await priceServiceConnection.getLatestVaas([
  "0xe62df6c8b4a85fe1a67db44dc12de5db330f7ac66b72dc658afedf0f4a415b43",
]);
```

### Post price updates

Finally, post the price update to the Pyth program on Solana.
This step will create the price update account that your application reads from.
Applications typically combine posting the price update and invoking their application into a sequence of transactions.
The `PythSolanaReceiver` class in `@pythnetwork/pyth-solana-receiver` provides a convenient transaction builder to help with this process:

```typescript copy
import { PythSolanaReceiver } from "@pythnetwork/pyth-solana-receiver";

// You will need a Connection from @solana/web3.js and an AnchorWallet to create the receiver
const connection: Connection;
const wallet: AnchorWallet;
const pythSolanaReceiver = new PythSolanaReceiver({ connection, wallet });

// Set closeUpdateAccounts: true if you want to delete the price update account at the end of the transaction to reclaim rent.
const transactionBuilder = pythSolanaReceiver.newTransactionBuilder({
  closeUpdateAccounts: false,
});
await transactionBuilder.addPostPriceUpdates(priceUpdateData);

// Use this function to add your application-specific instructions to the builder
// await transactionBuilder.addPriceConsumerInstructions(...)

await pythSolanaReceiver.provider.sendAll(
  await transactionBuilder.buildVersionedTransactions({
    computeUnitPriceMicroLamports: 50000,
  }),
  { skipPreflight: true }
);
```

TODO: link to SDK documentation to show how to use this builder better.

## Additional Resources

You may find these additional resources helpful for developing your Solana application.

### Example application

The [Solana example application](https://github.com/guibescos/my_first_pyth_app) is an end-to-end application that uses Pyth Network prices on the Solana blockchain and in a frontend.
