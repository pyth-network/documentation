# How to Use Real-Time Data in EVM Contracts

This guide explains how to use real-time Pyth data in EVM contracts.

## Install Pyth SDKs

Pyth provides two SDKs for the on- and off-chain portions of the integration.

### Solidity SDK

Pyth provides a [Solidity SDK](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/ethereum/sdk/solidity) which exposes `IPyth` interface to interact with Pyth price feeds.

**Truffle/Hardhat**

If you are using Truffle or Hardhat, simply install the NPM package:

```bash
npm install @pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity
```

**Foundry**

If you are using Foundry, you will need to create an NPM project if you don't already have one.
From the root directory of your project, run:

```bash
npm init -y
npm install @pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity
```

Then add the following line to your `remappings.txt` file:

```text
@pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity/=node_modules/@pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity
```

### Typescript SDK

Add [pyth-evm-js](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/ethereum/sdk/js) to your off-chain dependencies.

```bash copy
npm install --save @pythnetwork/pyth-evm-js
```

## Write Contract Code

Add code to your contract to update and read the Pyth price.
Your contract should do the following four steps:

1. Instantiate the `IPyth` interface from the Solidity SDK using the price feeds [contract address](../contract-addresses/evm).
1. Select the [Price Feed Ids](https://pyth.network/developers/price-feed-ids) for the assets you want to fetch prices for. Price feeds come in two varieties, Stable and Beta. You should select Stable feed ids
1. Call `IPyth.getUpdateFee` to calculate the fee charged by Pyth to update the price.
1. Call `IPyth.updatePriceFeeds` to update the price, paying the fee calculated in the previous step.
1. Call `IPyth.getPrice` to read the current price, providing the [price feed ID](https://pyth.network/developers/price-feed-ids) that you wish to read.

Simply add this argument to the functions on your contract that need it.

The code snippet below provides a general template for what your contract code should look like:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity/IPyth.sol";
import "@pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity/PythStructs.sol";

contract SomeContract {
  IPyth pyth;

  constructor(address pythContract) {
    pyth = IPyth(pythContract);
  }

  function doSomething(
    uint someArg,
    string memory otherArg,
    bytes[] calldata priceUpdateData
  ) public payable {
    // Update the on-chain Pyth price(s)
    uint fee = pyth.getUpdateFee(priceUpdateData);
    pyth.updatePriceFeeds{ value: fee }(priceUpdateData);

    // Read the current price
    bytes32 priceId = 0xf9c0172ba10dfa4d19088d94f5bf61d3b54d5bd7483a322a982e1373ee8ea31b;
    PythStructs.Price price = pyth.getPrice(priceId);
  }
}

```

## Write Frontend Code

Add frontend code to query price update data and pass it to your contract.
Your frontend code should do the following things:

1. Get a Hermes instance from the list of providers [here](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/api-instances-and-providers/hermes#node-providers). You can use the Stable [Hermes instance] hosted publically by Pyth Data Assosciation for development purposes.
1. Instantiate an `[EvmPriceServiceConnection]`(https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/blob/main/target_chains/ethereum/sdk/js/src/EvmPriceServiceConnection.ts) pointing to your Hermes instance.
1. Get price update data using this connection -- you can either perform one-off queries for this using `getPriceFeedsUpdateData` or subscribe for real-time updates via websocket.
1. Optionally get the Pyth fee required to perform the price update.
   You will need to do this step if your app is passing Pyth fees on to end users.
1. Pass the price update data to your contract.
   If you are passing along pyth fees, you will additionally need to provide the `value` parameter with the fee from the previous step.

```typescript copy
import { EvmPriceServiceConnection } from "@pythnetwork/pyth-evm-js";

async function run() {
  const connection = new EvmPriceServiceConnection("https://hermes.pyth.network");
  const priceIds = ["fill this in with your ids"]
  const priceFeedUpdateData = await connection.getPriceFeedsUpdateData(
    priceIds
  );

  // If necessary, you can collect the price update fee from the pythContract.
  //
  // `pythContract` below is a web3.js contract; if you wish to use ethers, you need to change it accordingly.
  // You can find the Pyth interface ABI in @pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity npm package.
  const pythContract = ...;
  const updateFee = await pythContract.methods
    .getUpdateFee(priceFeedUpdateData)
    .call();

  // Pass the update data to your contract.
  // `someContract` below is a web3.js contract; if you wish to use ethers, you need to change it accordingly.
  const someContract = ...;
  await someContract.methods
    .doSomething(someArg, otherArg, priceFeedUpdateData)
    .send({ value: updateFee });
}

run();
```

## Additional Resources

You may find these additional resources helpful for developing your EVM application.

### API Reference

The [EVM API reference](../api-reference/evm/) lets you interactively explore the complete API of the Pyth contract.

### Error Codes

The [EVM error codes](../error-codes/evm/) page lists the error codes that the Pyth contract may return.

### Example Applications

[Oracle Swap](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/ethereum/examples/oracle_swap) is an end-to-end example application that uses Pyth Network price feeds.
This application is an AMM that allows users to swap two assets at the Pyth-provided exchange rate. The example contains both the contract and a frontend to interact with it.
