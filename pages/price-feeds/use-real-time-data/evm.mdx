# Pyth on EVM

On-chain EVM programs can use the [Solidity SDK](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/ethereum/sdk/solidity) to read Pyth prices.
The [EVM API reference](../api-reference/evm) lets you interactively explore the complete API of the Pyth contract.

The off-chain portion of the application can use [pyth-evm-js](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/ethereum/sdk/js) to generate price update transactions.

Then follow the [Quickstart](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/ethereum/sdk/js#quickstart) guide, which includes an example of both the on- and off-chain code necessary to integrate with Pyth.

## Additional Resources

### Contract Addresses

Developers will need the address of the Pyth price feed contract on their blockchain in order to use Pyth.
Please consult [EVM Contract Addresses](../contract-addresses/evm) to find the address for your blockchain.

### Price Feed IDs

Consult the [Price Feed IDs](https://pyth.network/developers/price-feed-ids) reference to find the IDs of the price feeds you wish to use.

### Example Application

[Oracle Swap](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/ethereum/examples/oracle_swap) is an end-to-end example application that uses Pyth Network price feeds.
This application is an AMM that allows users to swap two assets at the Pyth-provided exchange rate. The example contains both the contract and a frontend to interact with it.
