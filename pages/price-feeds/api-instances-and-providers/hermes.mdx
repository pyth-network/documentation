# Hermes

## Public Endpoints

The Pyth Data Association operates two public endpoints for Hermes, which can be used to test integrations with Pyth
Network:

| Channel | URL                              |
| ------- | -------------------------------- |
| Stable  | https://hermes.pyth.network      |
| Beta    | https://hermes-beta.pyth.network |

For production deployments, developers integrating with Pyth Network are **strongly encouraged** to host their own
instance of Hermes or obtain a Hermes node from our RPC providers for maximum resilience and decentralization.

## Node Providers

The following node providers offer Hermes:

- [Triton](https://triton.one)
- [P2P](https://p2p.org)
- [extrnode](https://extrnode.com/)
