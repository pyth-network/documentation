# Hermes

## Public Endpoints

The Pyth Data Association operates two public endpoints for Hermes, which can be used to test integrations with Pyth
Network:

| Channel | URL                              |
| ------- | -------------------------------- |
| Stable  | https://hermes.pyth.network      |
| Beta    | https://hermes-beta.pyth.network |

Users must select a Hermes instance with the same channel (Stable / Beta) as their price feed contract.
Stable represents the production data feeds, and Beta is a testing environment for development purposes.
Most users should select Stable for both Hermes and the contract.
Stable feeds are available on both mainnet and most testnets (including all EVM testnets).

For production deployments, developers integrating with Pyth Network are **strongly encouraged** to host their own
instance of Hermes or obtain a Hermes node from our RPC providers for maximum resilience and decentralization.

## Node Providers

The following node providers offer Hermes:

- [Triton](https://triton.one)
- [P2P](https://p2p.org)
- [extrnode](https://extrnode.com/)
- [Liquify](https://www.liquify.io/)

## Self-Hosting

We provide a Helm chart for running Hermes in our
[charts](https://github.com/pyth-network/charts/tree/main/charts/hermes) repository. Please refer to the chart's readme
for the configuration values.
You will need a Pythnet RPC to run Hermes; see the [guide for accessing a Pythnet RPC](pythnet-rpc).
