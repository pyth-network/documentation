# Acquire an Access Token

This guide explains how to acquire an access token for Pyth Pro, which is required to authenticate websocket connections and subscribe to price updates.

## Request Access Token

Please fill out [this form](https://tally.so/r/3xG8E5) to contact the Pyth team and get the access token.

<Callout type="info">
  Access tokens are required for all Pyth Pro websocket connections. Make sure
  to keep your token secure and do not share it publicly.
</Callout>

## Using the Access Token

Once you receive your access token, use it to authenticate the websocket connection by passing it as an `Authorization` header with the value `Bearer {token}`.

### Example Usage

```js copy
import { PythLazerClient } from "@pythnetwork/pyth-lazer-sdk";

const client = await PythLazerClient.create(
  ["wss://pyth-lazer.dourolabs.app/v1/stream"],
  "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
);
```

## Next Steps

After acquiring your access token, you can proceed to [subscribe to price feeds](./subscribe-price-updates.mdx) using the Pyth Pro websocket API.
