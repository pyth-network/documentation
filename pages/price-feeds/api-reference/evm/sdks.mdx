# SDKs

The [@pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity)
([github](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/ethereum/sdk/solidity))
package provides solidity interfaces for the EVM contract as well as contract ABIs for off-chain applications.

## Installation Instructions

<Tabs items={['Solidity (Foundry)', 'Solidity (Truffle/Hardhat)','Typescript']}>
    <Tab>
        If you are using Foundry, you will need to create an NPM project if you don't already have one.
        From the root directory of your project, run:

        ```bash copy
        npm init -y
        npm install @pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity
        ```

        Then add the following line to your `remappings.txt` file:

        ```text copy
        @pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity/=node_modules/@pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity
        ```

        You can now import interfaces from the SDK in Solidity code as follows:

        ```solidity copy
        import "@pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity/IPyth.sol";
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        First, install the NPM package:

        ```bash
        npm install @pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity
        ```

        You can now import interfaces from the SDK in Solidity code as follows:

        ```solidity copy
        import "@pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity/IPyth.sol";
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        First, install the SDK in your project by running:
        ```
        npm install @pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity
        ```

        Then you can import the contract ABI in your typescript code as follows:

        ```typescript copy
        import PythAbi from "@pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity/abis/IPyth.json" assert { type: "json" };
        ```

        The same directory also contains ABI files for errors (`PythErrors.json`) and events (`IPythEvents.json`),
        which you may also find useful for decoding contract responses.
    </Tab>

</Tabs>
