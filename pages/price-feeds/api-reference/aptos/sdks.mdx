# SDKs

Aptos contracts can program against the Pyth contract's interface by including it as a project dependency.

## Installation Instructions

<Tabs items={['Move']}>
    <Tab>
        First, add the Pyth contract to your project dependencies by adding the following line to the `[dependencies]` section of `Move.toml`:

        ```toml
        [dependencies]
        Pyth = { git = "https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain.git", subdir = "target_chains/aptos/contracts", rev = "main" }
        ```

        Note that this dependency references the latest version of the Pyth contract code.
        You can also choose the most recent git sha in order to have a repeatable build.
        This contract was compiled with [aptos-cli v1.0.4](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/releases/tag/aptos-cli-v1.0.4).

        Next, add the following named addresses to the `[addresses]` section of `Move.toml`:

        ```toml
        [addresses]
        pyth = "0x7e783b349d3e89cf5931af376ebeadbfab855b3fa239b7ada8f5a92fbea6b387"
        deployer = "0xb31e712b26fd295357355f6845e77c888298636609e93bc9b05f0f604049f434"
        wormhole = "0x5bc11445584a763c1fa7ed39081f1b920954da14e04b32440cba863d03e19625"
        ```

        These lines allow you to reference Pyth resources as `pyth` instead of manually writing the contract address.
        The contract addresses provided above are for both Aptos mainnet and testnet -- the Pyth contract has the same address in both cases.

        You can now import the Pyth interfaces in Move code as follows:

        ```rust copy
        use pyth::pyth;
        ```
    </Tab>

</Tabs>
