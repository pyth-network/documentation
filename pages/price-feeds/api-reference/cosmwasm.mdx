# Pyth Price Feeds CosmWasm Contract Reference

The Pyth Network CosmWasm contract allows users to submit price updates for verification and can store them for later use.
Please see the documentation section on [Pull Updates](../pythnet-price-feeds/pull-updates) if you haven't already;
this section will explain the differences between Pyth Network and other oracles, and help you understand the expected usage patterns.

Users of the Pyth contract will typically need to perform two operations:

- Update the on-chain price -- In off-chain code, retrieve a price update from the
  [Hermes](../pythnet-price-feeds/hermes) and execute [UpdatePriceFeeds](cosmwasm/execute-update-price-feeds).
  This operation makes the price available for on-chain use.
  You will typically put this message at the beginning of a transaction, and subsequent messages in the transaction
  can consume the new price.
- Read the on-chain price -- After updating the price, your on-chain contract can send the [PriceFeed](cosmwasm/query-price-feed) query
  to the Pyth contract to get the current price.
