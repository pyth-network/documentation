# How To Schedule Price Updates

The following guides explain how to schedule Pyth price updates to occur at regular intervals.
On most chains (except Solana), application developers are responsible for updating the on-chain Pyth price before using it.
Please see [_Pull Updates_](pythnet-price-feeds/pull-updates) to learn more about this topic and compare different approaches to integrating with pull updates.
Scheduling price updates is one possible approach to solving this problem, but others are possible.

There are two different ways to schedule price updates:

- [Gelato](schedule-price-updates/using-gelato) provides a turnkey automation solution for scheduled updates.
- [Scheduler](schedule-price-updates/using-scheduler) is a service that developers can run to trigger price updates when certain time or price change conditions are met.

For developers comparing these two options, Gelato is simpler, in that it does not require you to operate a service.
However, Scheduler supports more blockchains than Gelato.
