# How to Use Real-Time Price Data

The following guides demonstrate how to consume Pyth real-time prices on various blockchains.
These guides are intended for developers building on-chain applications that need the latest price data, i.e., the price data must
be on the blockchain.

Pyth price feeds are available on 100+ blockchain ecosystems.
Check out the complete list of chains and implementation contract addresses at [Contract Addresses](contract-addresses).
If your blockchain is not supported, please [ask in the dev-forum](https://dev-forum.pyth.network/latest).

## Choosing Your Integration Method

**Pull integration** is the default choice for most applications. You manually pull the latest price data in your smart contract when needed.

**Push integration** is for applications that don't want to manually pull prices in every transaction and prefer to rely on [Price Pushers](/price-feeds/schedule-price-updates) or [Push-Feeds](/price-feeds/push-feeds) that automatically maintain up-to-date prices on-chain.

<Callout type="info">
  Pyth is fundamentally a pull oracle, and all feeds are available through both
  integration methods. If you want to use push integration, you can push the
  prices for the feeds you need. You can run a [Price
  Pusher](/price-feeds/schedule-price-updates) or ask the team to add the feeds
  you need by filling out [this form](https://tally.so/r/nGz2jj).

## Pull Integration

Consult the relevant ecosystem guide to get started using **pull integration**:

- [EVM](use-real-time-data/pull-integration/evm)
- [Solana](use-real-time-data/pull-integration/solana)
- [Starknet](use-real-time-data/pull-integration/starknet)
- [Aptos](use-real-time-data/pull-integration/aptos.md)
- [CosmWasm](use-real-time-data/pull-integration/cosmwasm.md)
- [Sui](use-real-time-data/pull-integration/sui.md)
- [IOTA](use-real-time-data/pull-integration/iota.md)
- [Near](use-real-time-data/pull-integration/near.md)

## Push Integration

To consume real-time price data using **push** integration, check out the following guides:

- [Using Push Integration](use-real-time-data/push-integration)

This guide will walk you through the steps to use real-time price data using push integration in every ecosystem.

## Off-Chain Applications

Pyth price feeds can also be used in off-chain applications.
For example, an application may need to show real-time asset prices on a website.
Developers building such applications can consult the following guide:

- [Off-chain Apps](use-real-time-data/off-chain.md)

To fetch historical prices, application developers can check out the [Use Historic Price Data](use-historic-price-data) guide.
