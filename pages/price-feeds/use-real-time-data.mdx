# How to Use Real-Time Price Data

The following guides demonstrate how to consume Pyth real-time prices on various blockchains.
These guides are intended for developers building on-chain applications that need latest price data, i.e., the price data must
be on the blockchain.

Pyth price feeds are available on 100+ blockchain ecosystems.
Check out the complete list of chains and implementation contract addresses at [Contract Addresses](contract-addresses).

If your blockchain is not supported, please [ask in the dev-forum](https://dev-forum.pyth.network/latest).

## Pull Integration

Consult the relevant ecosystem guide to get started using Pyth **Pull Integration:**

- [EVM](use-real-time-data/pull-integration/evm)
- [Solana](use-real-time-data/pull-integration/solana)
- [Aptos](use-real-time-data/pull-integration/aptos.md)
- [CosmWasm](use-real-time-data/pull-integration/cosmwasm.md)
- [Sui](use-real-time-data/pull-integration/sui.md)
- [IOTA](use-real-time-data/pull-integration/iota.md)
- [Near](use-real-time-data/pull-integration/near.md)

## Push Integration

To consume real-time price data using **push** integration, check out the following guides:

- [Using Push Integration](use-real-time-data/push-integration)

This guide will walk you through the steps to use real-time price data using Push Integration in every ecosystem.

## Off-Chain Applications

Pyth price feeds can also be used in off-chain applications.
For example, an application may need to show real-time asset prices on a website.
Developers building such applications can consult the following guide:

- [Off-chain Apps](use-real-time-data/off-chain.md)

To fetch historical prices, application developers can check out the [Use Historic Price Data](use-historic-price-data) guide.
