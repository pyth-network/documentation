# How to Use Real-Time Price Data

The following guides demonstrate how to consume Pyth real-time prices on various blockchains.
These guides are intended for developers building on-chain applications that need price data, i.e., the price data must
be on the blockchain.

Pyth price feeds are available on many blockchains across multiple ecosystems.
To check if your blockchain is supported, please consult [Contract Addresses](contract-addresses) to determine whether there is a Pyth deployment.
If your blockchain is not supported, please [ask in Discord](https://discord.gg/invite/PythNetwork).
Then, consult the relevant ecosystem guide to get started using Pyth real-time price data:

- [EVM](use-real-time-data/evm)
- [Solana](use-real-time-data/solana)
- [Aptos](use-real-time-data/aptos.md)
- [CosmWasm](use-real-time-data/cosmwasm.md)
- [Sui](use-real-time-data/sui.md)
- [Near](use-real-time-data/sui.md)

Pyth price feeds can also be used in off-chain applications.
For example, an application may need to show real-time asset prices on a website.
Developers building such applications can consult the following guide:

- [Off-chain Apps](use-real-time-data/off-chain.md)

Off-chain application developers should also consider using [Benchmarks](../benchmarks).
In addition to real-time data, Benchmarks provides access to historical Pyth prices.
Historical prices are useful for developers building price charts or graphs.
Benchmarks is typically a better option for such applications.
