# Push Feeds

The Pyth Data Association **pushes** price updates for various feeds on some networks.
These feeds are updated at a specific heartbeat rate or when the price changes by a specific percentage.
Developers don't need to [pull prices](./fetch-price-updates.mdx) for the following feeds, unless they required short update intervals.

The feeds can vary by network. Please see the relevant section below for the network of interest.

- [EVM](pushed-feeds/evm)
- [Solana](pushed-feeds/solana)
- [Fogo](pushed-feeds/fogo)
- [Aptos](pushed-feeds/aptos)
- [Sui](pushed-feeds/sui)
- [Movement](pushed-feeds/movement)

  DISCLAIMER: While the Pyth Data Association strives to deliver timely updates,
  these Push feeds may occasionally experience delays in updates caused by
  chain halts, gas estimations and other issues. Applications are advised to run
  their own scheduler. Find out how you can run your own scheduler
  [here](/price-feeds/schedule-price-updates/using-scheduler).
