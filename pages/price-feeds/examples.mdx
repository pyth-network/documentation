# Example Applications

[Oracle Swap](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/ethereum/examples/oracle_swap) is an end-to-end example application that uses Pyth Network price feeds.
This application is an AMM that allows users to swap two assets at the Pyth-provided exchange rate. The example contains both the contract and a frontend to interact with it.
