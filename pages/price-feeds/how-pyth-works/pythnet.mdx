# Pythnet

Pythnet is an application-specific blockchain operated by Pyth's data providers.
This blockchain is a computation substrate to securely combine the data provider's prices into a single aggregate price for each Pyth price feed.
Pythnet forms the core of Pyth's off-chain price feeds that serve all blockchains (except Solana mainnet).

Pythnet is powered by Solana technology: it runs the same validator software, but is a Pyth specific chain that is independent of Solana's mainnet.
The Pyth Data Association enables each data provider to operate one validator by delegating them the necessary stake.
Once governance is live, it will take over management of validators from the Pyth Data Association.

The purpose of Pythnet is to provide a secure and reliable computing substrate for Pyth's price aggregation.
Recall that Pyth's data providers submit their own price measurements for each product.
The Pyth protocol needs to combine these prices to produce a single aggregate price.
This computation needs to be performed securely -- prices must be combined correctly -- and reliably -- so that accurate and up-to-date price information is always available for applications.
Pythnet solves both of these problems.
First, anyone can validate that the price computation is done correctly by replaying the network's transaction log.
The Wormhole guardians perform this validation when constructing the Pyth price update messages that are delivered to other blockchains.
Consequently, as long as 2/3+ of the Wormhole guardians are honest, users of Pyth prices can trust that they were computed accurately.
Second, the Pythnet blockchain has built-in redundancy to ensure high availability: it is operational as long as 2/3+ of Pythnet validators are online.
Furthermore, Pythnet remains available even when target chain transaction bandwidth is highly contested, such as during periods of high market volatility.
