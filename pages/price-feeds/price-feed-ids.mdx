# Price Feed IDs

Every Pyth Price Feed has a unique ID, representing the specific pair of assets being priced (e.g. BTC/USD).
Every price update is tagged with the corresponding price feed ID.
Applications need to store the IDs of the feeds they wish to read.
However, the IDs may be represented in different formats (e.g. hex or base58) depending on the blockchain.
Price feeds also have different IDs in the Stable and Beta channels.

Refer to the [Price Feed ID reference catalog](https://pyth.network/developers/price-feed-ids) to identify a feed's ID in your chosen ecosystem.

At the time of writing, Pyth provides price feeds of the following asset types:

- **Crypto**: Real-time price feeds for cryptocurrencies and digital assets.
  - **Redemption Rates** (Coming soon): Price feeds for redemption rates of liquid staking derivatives and interest-bearing assets, sourced directly from smart contracts.
  - **Crypto.Index**: Aggregated price feeds representing baskets of digital assets.
- **Forex (FX)**: Real-time price feeds for major fiat currency pairs.
- **Equity**: Real-time price feeds for US stocks.
- **Metals**: Real-time price feeds for precious metals.
- **Rates** (Coming soon): Real-time interest rate feeds, including benchmark rates.

## Solana Price Feed Accounts

On Solana, each feed additionally has a collection of **price feed accounts** containing the feed's data.
The addresses of these accounts are programmatically derived from the feed id and a shard id, which is simply a 16-bit number.
See [How to Use Real-Time Data on Solana](./use-real-time-data/solana#price-feed-accounts) for more information on price feed accounts.
