# Price Feed IDs

Every Pyth Price Feed has a unique ID, representing the specific pair of assets being priced (e.g., BTC/USD).
Every price update is tagged with the corresponding price feed ID.
Applications need to store the IDs of the feeds they wish to read.

Please see the list of [Price Feed IDs](https://pyth.network/developers/price-feed-ids) to find the feed IDs for your ecosystem.
