# Price Feed IDs

Every Pyth Price Feed has a unique ID, representing the specific pair of assets being priced (e.g. BTC/USD).
Every price update is tagged with the corresponding price feed ID.
Applications need to store the IDs of the feeds they wish to read.
However, the IDs may be represented in different formats (e.g. hex or base58) depending on the blockchain.
Price feeds also have different IDs in the Stable and Beta channels.

Refer to the [Price Feed ID reference catalog](https://pyth.network/developers/price-feed-ids) to identify a feed's ID in your chosen ecosystem.

# Solana Price Feed Accounts

On Solana, each feed additionally has a collection of **price feed accounts** containing the feed's data.
The addresses of these accounts are programmatically derived from the feed id and a shard id, which is simply a 16-bit number.
See [How to Use Real-Time Data on Solana](./use-real-time-data/solana#price-feed-accounts) for more information on price feed accounts.
