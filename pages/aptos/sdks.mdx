# SDKs

Aptos contracts can depend on the Pyth contract by including it in their project as a dependency.
Off-chain software can use

The [@pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity)
([github](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/ethereum/sdk/solidity))
package provides solidity interfaces for the EVM contract as well as contract ABIs for off-chain applications.

## Installation Instructions

        First, add the Pyth contract to your project dependencies by adding the following line:

        ```toml
        [dependencies]
        Pyth = { git = "https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain.git", subdir = "aptos/contracts", rev = "main" }
        ```

        Note that this will always reference the latest version of the Pyth contract code at `main`.
        You

        Next, add the following line to `remappings.txt` in the root of your Foundry project.

        ```sh copy
        pyth-sdk-solidity/=lib/pyth-sdk-solidity/
        ```

        You can now import interfaces from the SDK in Solidity code as follows:

        ```solidity copy
        import "pyth-sdk-solidity/IPyth.sol";
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        First, install the SDK in your project by running:
        ```
        npm install @pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity
        ```

        Then you can import the contract ABI in your typescript code as follows:

        ```typescript copy
        import PythAbi from "@pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity/abis/IPyth.json" assert { type: "json" };
        ```

        The same directory also contains ABI files for errors (`PythErrors.json`) and events (`IPythEvents.json`),
        which you may also find useful for decoding contract responses.
