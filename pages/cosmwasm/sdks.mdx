# SDKs

The [@pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity)
([github](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/ethereum/sdk/solidity))
package provides solidity interfaces for the EVM contract as well as contract ABIs for off-chain applications.

## Installation Instructions

        First, install the SDK in your project by running:

        ```sh copy
        forge install pyth-network/pyth-sdk-solidity@v2.2.0
        ```

        Next, add the following line to `remappings.txt` in the root of your Foundry project.

        ```sh copy
        pyth-sdk-solidity/=lib/pyth-sdk-solidity/
        ```

        You can now import interfaces from the SDK in Solidity code as follows:

        ```solidity copy
        import "pyth-sdk-solidity/IPyth.sol";
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        First, install the SDK in your project by running:
        ```
        npm install @pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity
        ```

        Then you can import the contract ABI in your typescript code as follows:

        ```typescript copy
        import PythAbi from "@pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity/abis/IPyth.json" assert { type: "json" };
        ```

        The same directory also contains ABI files for errors (`PythErrors.json`) and events (`IPythEvents.json`),
        which you may also find useful for decoding contract responses.
