# SDKs

The [pyth-sdk-cw](https://crates.io/crates/pyth-sdk-cw) ([github](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/cosmwasm/sdk))
crate provides Rust interfaces for the Pyth CosmWasm contract for use in on-chain applications.

Off-chain users can use any cosmwasm SDK.
The Typescript examples in the documentation use [@cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate).
