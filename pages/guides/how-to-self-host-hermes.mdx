# How to self host Hermes

This guide explains how to self-host [Hermes](../documentation/pythnet-price-feeds/hermes.mdx). Hermes is Pyth Network's permissionless API server for Pyth price updates.
It connects to both Pythnet and Wormhole to provide verified price update data for cross-chain usage. Please refer to the
[Pyth cross-chain documentation](https://pyth-network.gitbook.io/pyth-network/pyth-cross-chain) for more information on how Pyth works.

To run hermes you need to have access to a Pythnet RPC or run your own. This guide will explain how to run your own Pythnet RPC but it is recommended to use a node provider for more reliability and availability.
You can use the following node providers to get access to a Pythnet RPC:

- [Blockdaemon](https://blockdaemon.com/)
- [Figment](https://figment.io/)
- [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/)

## Self-hosting on Kubernetes

This section explains how to self-host Hermes on Kubernetes. It assumes that you have a basic understanding of Kubernetes and Helm. If you are new to Kubernetes, you can use the
following resources to get started:

- [Kubernetes Basics](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/)
- [Helm Quickstart](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/)

### Requirements

- A running Kubernetes cluster: You can use [microk8s](https://microk8s.io/) or [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) to run a single node cluster on production machine.
  - The cluster nodes should have sufficient resources to run the Pythnet RPC and Hermes. Pythnet RPC requires at least 4 CPU cores and 4GB of RAM and Hermes requires at least 1
    CPU core and 1GB of RAM.
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/) installed on your machine.

### Steps

#### Add Pythnet Helm repository

Run the following command to add the Pythnet Helm repository:

```bash
helm repo add pythnet https://pyth-network.github.io/charts
```

#### Pythnet RPC

**Note:**It is recommended to use a node provider for more reliability and availability. If you are using a node provider, you can skip this step and go to the [Hermes](#hermes) section.

Run the following command to install the Pythnet RPC with the release name of `pythnet-rpc`:

```bash
helm install pythnet-rpc pythnet/pythnet-rpc
```

You can customize the Pythnet RPC configuration by passing an extra values files to the helm install command like so:

```bash
helm install pythnet-rpc pythnet/pythnet-rpc -f pythnet-rpc-values.yaml
```

You can fine the default values in the [pythnet-rpc/values.yaml](https://github.com/pyth-network/charts/blob/main/charts/pythnet-rpc/values.yaml) file.

Pythnet RPC helm chart creates a Service of type 'ClusterIP' to expose the RPC service that Hermes will use to connect to Pythnet RPC. You can find the services
by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl get svc
```

When DNS is configured for your cluster, Kubernetes will create a DNS entry for the service. You can use the service name to connect to the Pythnet RPC from Hermes
within the cluster. For example, if the service name is `pythnet-rpc` then you can use the following URLs to connect to the Pythnet RPC Http and WebSocket endpoints:

```
http://pythnet-rpc:8899
ws://pythnet-rpc:89000
```

##### Testing the Pythnet RPC

Run the following command to forward the Pythnet Http RPC port to your local machine:

```bash
kubectl port-forward service/pythnet-rpc 8899:8899
```

To make sure that the Pythnet RPC is running correctly, run the following command a couple of times:

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:8899' \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1, "method":"getSlot"}'
```

If the slot number is increasing then the Pythnet RPC is running correctly.

#### Hermes

Create a file named `hermes-values.yaml` and put the Pythnet RPC Http and WebSocket endpoints in it like so:

```yaml
hermes:
  pythnetHttpEndpoint: "http(s)://fill-this-out/"
  pythnetWsEndpoint: "ws(s)://fill-this-out/"
```

Then, run the following command to install Hermes with the release name of `hermes` in your cluster:

```bash
helm install hermes pythnet/hermes --values hermes-values.yaml
```

You can customize the Hermes configuration by adjusting the default values in the [hermes/values.yaml](https://github.com/pyth-network/charts/blob/main/charts/hermes/values.yaml).

Hermes helm chart creates a Service of type 'ClusterIP' that exposes the Hermes service only internally within the cluster. To expose it publicly you can either change this to a
`NodePort` or `LoadBalancer` service or use an Ingress controller.

##### Expose Hermes using NodePort service type

If you are running a single node cluster, you can use a NodePort to expose the Hermes service to the outside world. To do so, add the following values to the `hermes-values.yaml` file:

```yaml
service:
  type: NodePort
```

Then, run the following command to upgrade the Hermes installation:

```bash
helm upgrade hermes pythnet/hermes --values hermes-values.yaml
```

You can find the NodePort by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl get svc
```

You can use the port number listed under the `PORT(S)` column to connect to Hermes from outside the cluster or configure a web server (like nginx) to proxy requests to Hermes.

#### Expose Hermes using LoadBalancer service type

To expose Hermes using a LoadBalancer you need to have a cluster that supports LoadBalancers. You can find more information about LoadBalancers in Kubernetes
[here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer). To expose Hermes using a LoadBalancer, add the following values to the `hermes-values.yaml` file:

```yaml
service:
  type: LoadBalancer
```

Then, run the following command to upgrade the Hermes installation:

```bash
helm upgrade hermes pythnet/hermes --values hermes-values.yaml
```

Based on the available LoadBalancer in your cluster, Kubernetes will create a LoadBalancer and assign an external IP address to it. You can find the external IP address by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl get svc
```

##### Use Ingress controller

You can use an Ingress controller to expose Hermes. You can find more information about Ingress controllers in Kubernetes [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/).

To use an Ingress controller, you need to modify [the ingress template on Hermes chart](https://github.com/pyth-network/charts/blob/main/charts/hermes/values.yaml#L52-L66) to match your Ingress
controller. For example, if you are using the [nginx ingress controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/) with [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/getting-started/) to manage TLS certificates,
you can add the following values to the `hermes-values.yaml` file:

```yaml
ingress:
  enabled: true
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
    cert-manager.io/issuer: letsencrypt
  hosts:
    - host: hermes.fancy-protocol.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: hermes-beta
                port:
                  number: 80
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - hermes.fancy-protocol.com
      secretName: hermes-tls
```

Then, run the following command to upgrade the Hermes installation:

```bash
helm upgrade hermes pythnet/hermes --values hermes-values.yaml
```

Once the upgrade is complete, you can use the `host` value in the ingress template to connect to Hermes from outside the cluster.

##### Testing Hermes

Run the following command to forward the Hermes Http port to your local machine:

```bash
kubectl port-forward service/hermes 8080:80
```

To make sure that Hermes is running correctly, run the following command to query the price of the ETH/USD pair:

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:8080/api/latest_price_feeds?ids[]=0xff61491a931112ddf1bd8147cd1b641375f79f5825126d665480874634fd0ace
```

#### Upgrading Helm charts to newer versions

To upgrade Pythnet RPC or Hermes helm chart to a newer version, run the following command:

```bash
helm upgrade <release-name> pythnet/<chart-name> --values <values-file>
```

If you wish to upgrade to a specific version of the chart, you can use the `--version` flag.
For example, to upgrade to version `0.1.1` of the Pythnet RPC chart, run the following command:

```bash
helm upgrade pythnet-rpc pythnet/pythnet-rpc --version 0.1.1 --values pythnet-rpc-values.yaml
```
