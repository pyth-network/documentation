#   What is PYTH?
    
    PYTH is the governance token of the Pyth Network.
    
    PYTH Token holders can access Pyth governance through the convenient staking and governance [frontend](https://staking.pyth.network/).
    
    Pyth Network’s governance system allows anyone with PYTH Tokens to participate. Token holders must stake their tokens in the Pyth staking program to vote on community governance proposals. Governance uses a 1:1 coin-voting system, where each staked token confers one vote.
    
    Proposals pass when a majority approves them, provided that a quorum of participants have voted. The current quorum for governance proposals is set at 0.25% of the PYTH tokens staked. 
    
    Proposals are binding on-chain: each proposal has one or more associated instructions that are executed when the proposal passes. Community governance proposals can relate to all of the following:
    
    - Determine the size of update fees.
    - Determine the reward distribution mechanism for publishers.
    - Approve other software updates to on-chain programs across blockchains.
    - Determine the price feeds are listed on Pyth and their reference data (e.g., number of decimal places in the price, reference exchanges).
    - Choose the publishers that are permissioned to provide data for each price feed

Please note that the scope of community governance proposals may be expanded if the PYTH token holders (or the Pyth DAO) decide so.
