# What is PYTH?

    PYTH is the governance token of the Pyth Network.

    PYTH Token holders can access Pyth governance through the convenient staking and governance [frontend](https://staking.pyth.network/).

    Pyth Network’s governance system allows anyone with PYTH Tokens to participate. Token holders must stake their tokens in the Pyth staking program to vote on community governance proposals. Governance uses a 1:1 coin-voting system, where each staked token confers one vote.

    Any PYTH Token holder can submit proposals to the Pyth DAO as long as they have 0.25% of the total PYTH tokens staked.

    A proposal is considered passed if it meets the following conditions at the end of the 7 day voting period:
    - More yesses have been cast than nos.
    - The "Approval Quorum" has been met. This is a percentage of staked tokens that must have voted yes for the proposal to pass. The threshold can vary depending on the type of proposal.  The current thresholds can be found in the "Governances" sections of the [parameters of the DAO](https://app.realms.today/dao/PYTH/params) as "Community Vote Threshold Percentage". It is expressed as a percentage of staked tokens at the start of the voting period for the proposal.

    Proposals are binding on-chain: each proposal has one or more associated instructions that are executed when the proposal passes. Community governance proposals can relate to all of the following:

    - Determine the size of update fees.
    - Determine the reward distribution mechanism for publishers.
    - Approve other software updates to on-chain programs across blockchains.
    - Determine the price feeds are listed on Pyth and their reference data (e.g., number of decimal places in the price, reference exchanges).
    - Choose the publishers that are permissioned to provide data for each price feed

Please note that the scope of community governance proposals may be expanded if the PYTH token holders (or the Pyth DAO) decide so.
